System.out.println(binary); // Output: 10
```

---

### 19. Type casting in Java

* Type casting converts one data type into another.
* Implicit casting (widening) happens automatically (e.g., int to long).
* Explicit casting (narrowing) requires a cast operator (e.g., double to int).
* Used to handle different data representations safely.
* Essential in arithmetic operations, method calls, and APIs expecting certain types.

**Summary:**
Casting enables data interoperability between types, ensuring compatibility and preventing data loss. Understanding implicit vs explicit casting helps avoid runtime errors and precision loss.

```java
int i = 100;
long l = i;  // implicit widening cast
double d = 9.78;
int j = (int) d;  // explicit narrowing cast
System.out.println(j);  // Output: 9
```

---

### 20. Demo of implicit and explicit casting

* Implicit (widening): smaller to larger data type; safe and automatic.
* Explicit (narrowing): larger to smaller; needs manual cast, may lose data.
* Important to know for correct arithmetic and avoiding exceptions.
* Useful when interfacing APIs or processing user input.
* Prevents errors by clarifying intent in code.

**Summary:**
Implicit casting simplifies data handling when moving to larger types. Explicit casting demands attention to prevent data truncation. Proper casting is essential for reliable Java programs.

```java
int x = 10;
double y = x; // implicit casting
double a = 9.99;
int b = (int) a; // explicit casting
System.out.println(y); // 10.0
System.out.println(b); // 9
```

    }

    void instancePrint() {
        System.out.println("Instance method called");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Printer.printMessage("Hello from static method!");
        Printer p = new Printer();
        p.instancePrint();
    }
}
```

---

### 38. Let’s say hi to main method again

* `public static void main(String[] args)` is Java’s program entry point.
* JVM looks for main method to start execution.
* `String[] args` holds command line arguments.
* `static` means JVM can call without creating object.
* Must be public for JVM access.

**Summary:**
The `main` method acts as the start line for every standalone Java application. Understanding its structure is key for writing programs that run correctly and accept input parameters.

---

### 39. How to create & initialize Java objects

* Use `new` keyword followed by constructor call.
* Syntax: `ClassName obj = new ClassName();`
* Constructor initializes the object’s state.
* Objects are stored on heap memory.
* Fields can be initialized using constructors or setters.

**Summary:**
Object creation and initialization is fundamental in Java OOP. Using constructors ensures objects are set up properly before use, enabling predictable behavior and state management.

**Code example:**

```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println(name + " is " + age + " years old.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p = new Person("Alice", 30);
        p.display();
    }
}
```

---

### 40. Introduction to Constructor in Java

* Special method with the same name as the class.
* Used to initialize new objects.

* Debugging constructors helps identify issues early in object creation.
* Set breakpoints inside constructors in IDEs like IntelliJ.
* Step through constructor execution to verify logic.
* Helps ensure fields are correctly initialized.

**Summary:**
Constructors are the first methods invoked for an object. Debugging them helps catch initialization errors early, making programs more robust. IDEs provide tools to step through constructors line-by-line.

**Code example:**

```java
class Product {
    String name;
    double price;

    Product(String name, double price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price; // Set breakpoint here to debug
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println(name + ": $" + price);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Product p = new Product("Laptop", 999.99);
        p.display();
    }
}
```

---

### 42. Problem with default or no-args constructor

* If no constructor is defined, Java provides a default no-args constructor.
* Default constructor does not initialize fields explicitly.
* Custom constructors remove the default no-args constructor.
* Missing no-args constructor causes compilation errors if code expects it.
* Important for frameworks that rely on no-args constructor (e.g., serialization).

**Summary:**
Relying on the default constructor can lead to uninitialized objects or errors when custom constructors exist. Defining explicit no-args constructors is essential, especially when integrating with certain libraries or frameworks.

---

### 43. Constructor Overloading in Java

* Multiple constructors with different parameter lists in the same class.
* Enables object creation with different initial states.
* Helps provide flexibility to users of the class.
* Java differentiates based on method signature.
* Overloading improves code readability and usability.

**Summary:**
Constructor overloading lets developers offer multiple ways to create objects, catering to different initialization needs while maintaining a clean API.

**Code example:**

```java
class Book {
    String title;
    String author;

    Book() {
        this.title = "Unknown";
        this.author = "Unknown";
    }

    Book(String title) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = "Unknown";
    }

    Book(String title, String author) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println(title + " by " + author);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Book b1 = new Book();
        Book b2 = new Book("1984");
        Book b3 = new Book("Brave New World", "Aldous Huxley");
        b1.display();
        b2.display();
        b3.display();
    }
}
```

### 44. Constructor chaining in Java

* Calling one constructor from another using `this()` keyword.
* Helps avoid code duplication in constructors.
* Must be the first statement in the constructor.
* Improves maintainability by centralizing initialization.
* Can chain multiple constructors in a sequence.

**Summary:**
Constructor chaining provides a clean, DRY way to initialize objects. It avoids repeated code and ensures consistent initialization logic across constructors.

---

### 45. Usage of return statement in constructor

* Constructors do **not** have a return type, so they cannot return values.
* `return;` statement can be used to exit constructor early but without a value.
* Using `return;` is rare and mostly unnecessary in constructors.
* Cannot return objects or primitives explicitly from constructors.
* Trying to return a value from constructor causes compile error.

**Summary:**
Unlike regular methods, constructors cannot return values. The `return;` keyword is only used to exit a constructor prematurely without returning data.

---

### 46. Instance Initialization Block in Java class - Part 1

* Code block defined with `{ ... }` inside a class but outside methods/constructors.
* Runs **every time** an object is created, before the constructor.
* Useful for common initialization shared by all constructors.
* Helps avoid code duplication when multiple constructors exist.
* Runs after field initializers but before constructor body.

**Summary:**
Instance Initialization Blocks provide a way to share initialization code across constructors. They are less common but useful for complex setup that applies regardless of constructor.

---

### 47. Instance Initialization Block in Java class - Part 2

* Can access instance variables and methods.
* Multiple instance blocks execute in order they appear.
* Helps in situations where constructors call each other but some init logic is common.
* Useful for logging or resource setup at object creation.
* Instance blocks run **before** constructor code executes.

**Summary:**
Instance initialization blocks offer a middle ground between field initializers and constructors, giving a unified place for initialization that always runs first during object creation.

**Code example:**

```java
class Demo {
    int x;
    {
        x = 10; // Instance Initialization Block
        System.out.println("Instance block executed");
    }

    Demo() {
        System.out.println("Constructor executed, x = " + x);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Demo();
    }
}
```

---

### 48. Introduction to static variables in Java

* Declared with `static` keyword inside class but outside methods.
* Belongs to the class, not to any specific object.
* Shared across all instances of the class.
* Initialized once when class loads into JVM.
* Useful for constants or shared counters.

**Summary:**
Static variables provide shared state or constants at the class level, accessible without object creation. They reduce memory usage and provide class-wide values.

---

### 49. How to define constant final static variables

* Use `static final` modifiers to declare constants.
* Constant values cannot be changed once initialized.
* Naming convention: uppercase letters with underscores.
* Initialized during declaration or in static blocks.
* Accessed via `ClassName.CONSTANT_NAME`.

**Summary:**
Final static variables are constants by design, ensuring values remain immutable and accessible globally, often used for configuration or fixed values.

**Code example:**

```java
class Constants {
    static final double PI = 3.14159;
    static final int MAX_USERS = 100;
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("PI: " + Constants.PI);
        System.out.println("Max Users: " + Constants.MAX_USERS);
    }
}
```

---
Great! Here’s the next set of 10 topics with explanations, summaries, and code examples where needed:

---

### 50. Differences between static & instance variables

* **Static variables** belong to the class, shared among all objects.
* **Instance variables** belong to individual objects; each object has its own copy.
* Static variables are initialized once when the class loads; instance variables when each object is created.
* Static variables accessed via class name; instance variables accessed via object references.
* Static variables useful for shared data; instance variables store object-specific data.

**Summary:**
Static and instance variables differ mainly in scope and lifecycle. Static variables are shared across all instances and exist once per class, while instance variables belong to and vary with each object.

---

### 51. Introduction to static methods in Java

* Static methods belong to the class, not any instance.
* Can be called without creating an object.
* Cannot access instance variables/methods directly.
* Often used for utility or helper methods.
* Use `static` keyword for declaration.

**Summary:**
Static methods provide class-level functionality callable without objects, commonly used for utility operations or when instance data isn’t required.

**Code example:**

```java
class MathUtil {
    static int square(int n) {
        return n * n;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(MathUtil.square(5));  // 25
    }
}
```

---

### 52. Static Initialization Block in Java class

* A special block to initialize static variables.
* Runs once when the class is loaded into JVM.
* Useful when initialization requires logic beyond simple assignment.
* Executes before any static methods or variables are accessed.
* Multiple static blocks execute in the order they appear.

**Summary:**
Static initialization blocks enable complex static variable initialization and run once at class load time, before any static method or variable usage.

---

### 53. Debugging of method invocations in IntelliJ

* Set breakpoints on method calls to pause execution.
* Step into methods to see detailed flow.
* Step over to run methods without going inside.
* Inspect parameters and local variables during debugging.
* Helps identify logical or runtime errors interactively.

**Summary:**
IntelliJ provides powerful debugging tools to trace method calls step-by-step, allowing deeper understanding and faster bug fixes.

---

### 54. Where does Java store classes, objects, variables, methods

* **Classes**: Loaded into Method Area (part of JVM memory).
* **Objects**: Created on Heap memory.
* **Local variables**: Stored in Stack memory per thread.
* **Methods**: Stored in Method Area along with class info.
* Helps JVM manage memory efficiently.

**Summary:**
JVM manages memory by segregating code, objects, and variables into distinct areas, facilitating efficient execution and garbage collection.

---

### 55. Deep dive on Heap memory and stack memory

* **Heap:** Stores objects and instance variables, shared across threads, garbage collected.
* **Stack:** Stores method frames, local variables, and method calls, thread-specific.
* Stack frames created/destroyed as methods are called/returned.
* Stack memory is limited but fast; heap is larger but slower.
* Proper management avoids memory leaks and stack overflow errors.

**Summary:**
Heap and stack are crucial JVM memory areas; understanding their roles helps write efficient, safe Java programs.

---

### 56. Introduction to null in Java

* `null` represents the absence of any object reference.
* Variables can be assigned `null` to indicate “no object”.
* Accessing methods/fields on `null` causes `NullPointerException`.
* Useful to initialize references or reset them.
* Always check for null before using object references.

**Summary:**
`null` is a special marker for “no object” in Java; cautious handling avoids common runtime exceptions.

---

### 57. Object Destruction and Garbage collection in Java

* Java automatically frees memory for unreachable objects via Garbage Collector (GC).
* No manual memory management by programmer.
* GC runs in background and reclaims heap space.
* Object finalization (`finalize()` method) is deprecated; not reliable.
* Helps prevent memory leaks but timing of GC is unpredictable.

**Summary:**
Java’s Garbage Collector manages memory cleanup, simplifying development but requiring understanding for optimal performance.

---

### 58. Class vs Object vs Instance vs Reference

* **Class:** Blueprint or template for objects.
* **Object:** Actual instance created from class.
* **Instance:** Same as object; one occurrence of a class.
* **Reference:** Variable holding the address of the object in memory.
* Class defines structure; objects hold data and behavior.

**Summary:**
Classes define structure, objects are concrete realizations, instances are synonymous with objects, and references point to objects in memory.

---
Absolutely! I’ll rearrange so that for each topic you get:

* 5 bullet points
* 5-line summary
* Then the code snippet at the end

Here’s the continuation with that format:

---

### 59. What is encapsulation in Java

* Encapsulation hides internal object details and exposes only what’s necessary.
* Private fields prevent unauthorized access from outside classes.
* Public getters/setters control how data is read or modified.
* Helps maintain code integrity and avoids accidental data corruption.
* Makes the code more modular, maintainable, and secure.

**Summary:**
Encapsulation is a core OOP principle that protects object state by restricting direct access to fields. By exposing controlled access via methods, it ensures the integrity of data and enforces business rules. This makes code more modular and easier to maintain, and it reduces the risk of unexpected side effects or bugs caused by uncontrolled data changes. It’s heavily used in real-world applications like banking, where sensitive data must be protected.

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        if (initialBalance < 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Balance can't be negative");
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if(amount > 0) balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if(amount > 0 && balance >= amount) balance -= amount;
        else System.out.println("Insufficient funds");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount(1000);
        account.deposit(500);
        account.withdraw(2000);  // Should show insufficient funds
        System.out.println("Balance: " + account.getBalance());
    }
}
```

---

### 60. Single line Comments in Java

* Use `//` to add brief notes or explanations in the code.
* Useful for clarifying intent or logic to yourself and others.
* Helps with debugging by temporarily disabling lines without deleting them.
* Improves code readability and maintainability.
* Ignored by the compiler, so no performance impact.

**Summary:**
Single line comments are the quickest way to add notes or disable code temporarily during debugging. They help improve code clarity for developers reading or maintaining the code later. In real-world projects, commenting critical logic or TODOs makes collaboration easier and reduces bugs.

```java
public class Calculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5;
        int b = 10;
        // int sum = a + b; // temporarily disabled
        System.out.println("Program running without sum calculation.");
    }
}
```

---

### 61. Multi-line Comments in Java

* Use `/* ... */` to comment out multiple lines or write detailed explanations.
* Great for describing complex logic or algorithms in code.
* Useful for temporarily disabling blocks of code during development.
* Can enhance collaboration by providing context or instructions.
* Ignored by the compiler and have no runtime effect.

**Summary:**
Multi-line comments allow developers to add comprehensive notes or disable sections of code for testing. They improve documentation and understanding of complicated parts, which is important in professional environments or open-source projects.

```java
public class MathUtils {
    public static int factorial(int n) {
        /*
         * Calculates factorial of a number n recursively.
         * factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)
         * factorial(0) = 1
         */
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}
```

---

### 62. Introduction to javadoc comments

* Javadoc comments begin with `/**` and end with `*/`.
* Used to document classes, methods, parameters, and exceptions.
* Supports tags like `@param`, `@return`, and `@throws`.
* Enables automatic generation of HTML documentation via the `javadoc` tool.
* Helps maintain clean, standardized documentation for APIs and libraries.

**Summary:**
Javadoc comments provide a structured way to document your Java code clearly, which helps other developers understand your APIs and facilitates automatic documentation generation. This is essential for professional-grade codebases and public libraries.

```java
/**
 * Utility class to perform string operations.
 */
public class StringUtils {

    /**
     * Reverses a given string.
     * @param input the string to reverse
     * @return reversed string
     */
    public static String reverse(String input) {
        return new StringBuilder(input).reverse().toString();
    }
}
```

---

### 63. Generating javadoc using IntelliJ

* IntelliJ IDEA can auto-generate javadoc comment templates with keyboard shortcuts.
* Supports generating full HTML documentation files via the GUI.
* Allows filtering by visibility modifiers (public, private, etc.) for docs.
* Makes it easier to maintain consistent documentation.
* Useful for large projects or APIs shared with teams or users.

**Summary:**
IntelliJ streamlines the creation and generation of javadoc documentation, improving developer productivity and ensuring your code is well documented and professional. This capability is particularly beneficial when building APIs or working in team environments.

*(No direct code snippet — refer to previous javadoc example.)*

---

### 64. Introduction to String Pool in Java

* String literals are stored in a shared pool to save memory.
* Identical literals share the same object reference in the pool.
* Using `new String()` creates distinct objects outside the pool.
* `intern()` method adds strings to the pool explicitly.
* Optimizes memory usage and enables fast equality checks with `==`.

**Summary:**
The String Pool is a memory optimization in Java where identical string literals share a single object instance. This reduces memory overhead and improves performance, especially in applications with many repeated strings like configuration keys or user roles.

```java
public class StringPoolDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "admin";
        String s2 = "admin";
        String s3 = new String("admin");
        System.out.println(s1 == s2);  // true (same pool reference)
        System.out.println(s1 == s3);  // false (new object)
        System.out.println(s1 == s3.intern());  // true (interned)
    }
}
```

---
Great! Here’s the next set with bullet points, summary, and code at the end, just like before.

---

### 65. The intern method in String

* `intern()` returns a canonical representation from the string pool.
* If the pool already contains a string equal to this, it returns that reference.
* Otherwise, it adds the string to the pool and returns its reference.
* Useful to save memory and allow faster equality checks (`==`).
* Commonly used in large apps where many identical strings are created dynamically.

**Summary:**
The `intern()` method helps manage string memory efficiently by ensuring that all equal strings share the same reference from the string pool. This is critical in performance-sensitive applications like parsers or compilers where strings are frequently created and compared.

```java
public class InternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = new String("hello");
        String s2 = "hello";
        System.out.println(s1 == s2);           // false, different objects
        System.out.println(s1.intern() == s2);  // true, same pooled object
    }
}
```

---

### 66. The concat method in String

* `concat()` joins two strings without altering the originals.
* Equivalent to using the `+` operator for string concatenation.
* Returns a new string that combines the original and argument string.
* Useful when chaining or dynamically building strings.
* Strings are immutable, so concat creates a fresh object every time.

**Summary:**
The `concat()` method joins two strings to create a new combined string without modifying the originals. This is helpful for assembling messages, file paths, or URLs where immutability and thread safety are important.

```java
public class ConcatDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "Hello";
        String s2 = " World";
        String s3 = s1.concat(s2);
        System.out.println(s3);  // Output: Hello World
    }
}
```

---

### 67. Escape sequence character & Unicode char values in String

* Escape sequences like `\n`, `\t`, `\\` represent special characters.
* Allows embedding newlines, tabs, quotes, and backslashes in strings.
* Unicode characters can be included using `\uXXXX` notation.
* Important for internationalization and formatting strings.
* Useful in file paths, user messages, and generating formatted output.

**Summary:**
Escape sequences allow you to embed special characters inside string literals, making text output cleaner and more readable. Unicode escapes extend support to global languages and symbols, which is vital for international applications.

```java
public class EscapeSequenceDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String message = "Line1\nLine2\tTabbed\nUnicode: \u263A";
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}
```

---

### 68. Finding the length of a String

* The `length()` method returns the number of characters in the string.
* Important for validating input or controlling loops.
* Helps in substring extraction or formatting logic.
* Returns an int value representing character count.
* Used extensively in parsing, UI input validations, and algorithms.

**Summary:**
Knowing the length of a string is fundamental when processing or validating textual data. It enables checks for empty strings, controls loops for character iteration, and helps manipulate substrings precisely.

```java
public class LengthDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "Hello World";
        int len = text.length();
        System.out.println("Length: " + len);  // Output: Length: 11
    }
}
```

---

### 69. Comparing Strings in Java

* Use `equals()` to compare string content (case-sensitive).
* `equalsIgnoreCase()` compares strings ignoring case differences.
* `==` compares references, not content, so generally avoid for strings.
* Important in conditions, searches, and input validations.
* Proper string comparison prevents bugs related to identity vs equality.

**Summary:**
Comparing strings by content rather than by reference is critical in Java to avoid logical errors. The `equals()` method is the standard for equality checks, while `==` should only be used when comparing if two references point to the exact same object.

```java
public class StringCompareDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "Java";
        String s2 = new String("Java");
        System.out.println(s1 == s2);             // false
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));        // true
        System.out.println(s1.equalsIgnoreCase("JAVA"));  // true
    }
}
```

---

Awesome! Here’s the next batch with real-time use cases, bullet explanations, summaries, and code at the end.

---

### 70. Fetching a character at an index in String

* Use `charAt(int index)` to get the character at a specific position.
* Index starts at 0, so `charAt(0)` returns the first character.
* Useful for parsing strings, validations, or algorithms like palindrome checks.
* Throws `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` if index is invalid.
* Common in text processing, data extraction, and user input analysis.

**Summary:**
Accessing a character at a given position allows granular inspection of string content. It is essential for validations, formatting, or algorithms that need to process strings character by character.

```java
public class CharAtDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String word = "Hello";
        char ch = word.charAt(1);
        System.out.println("Character at index 1: " + ch); // Output: e
    }
}
```

---

### 71. Checking if a String is empty

* Use `isEmpty()` method to check if string length is zero.
* Returns `true` if the string has no characters, else `false`.
* Useful for input validation before processing data.
* Different from `null` which means no reference, `isEmpty` checks content.
* Common in form validations, parsing, and data cleanup.

**Summary:**
`isEmpty()` is a simple, effective way to validate if a string contains no data. It helps avoid unnecessary processing and prevents errors in scenarios requiring non-empty inputs.

```java
public class IsEmptyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "";
        System.out.println("Is string empty? " + str.isEmpty()); // true
    }
}
```

---

### 72. Changing the case in String

* `toUpperCase()` converts all characters to uppercase.
* `toLowerCase()` converts all characters to lowercase.
* Useful for case-insensitive comparisons or formatting output.
* Does not modify original string (strings are immutable).
* Widely used in normalization before comparison or storage.

**Summary:**
Changing string case is a fundamental operation that aids in consistent comparisons and formatting. By normalizing case, applications avoid errors caused by inconsistent user input or data variations.

```java
public class CaseChangeDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = "Java Programming";
        System.out.println(input.toUpperCase());  // JAVA PROGRAMMING
        System.out.println(input.toLowerCase());  // java programming
    }
}
```

---

### 73. Converting values as String

* Use `String.valueOf()` to convert primitive types or objects to string.
* Supports int, double, boolean, char, and objects including null.
* Avoids manual concatenation or complex formatting.
* Handy for logging, UI display, and serialization.
* More readable and consistent than using `+ ""`.

**Summary:**
Converting other data types into strings is a frequent requirement, especially when outputting to console or UI. The `String.valueOf()` method provides a clean, null-safe way to convert diverse types into their string representations.

```java
public class ValueOfDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 100;
        boolean flag = true;
        System.out.println(String.valueOf(num));   // "100"
        System.out.println(String.valueOf(flag));  // "true"
    }
}
```

---

### 74. Searching for a value in String

* Use `indexOf()` to find the position of a substring or character.
* Returns the first index where the substring occurs or -1 if not found.
* `lastIndexOf()` finds the last occurrence of the substring.
* Useful for parsing, validation, or extracting substrings.
* Enables substring manipulations based on search results.

**Summary:**
Searching within strings is essential for tasks like validation, parsing, and extraction. The `indexOf()` method provides a direct way to locate substrings or characters, supporting dynamic string processing needs.

```java
public class SearchStringDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "hello world";
        int pos = text.indexOf("world");
        System.out.println("Position of 'world': " + pos);  // 6
    }
}
```

---

Great! Here's the next set with real-world explanations, 5-point insights, a short summary, and code examples at the end of each topic.

---

### 75. Trimming a String

* The `trim()` method removes leading and trailing spaces from a string.
* It’s useful when dealing with user input (e.g., login forms, CSV files).
* It does not modify the original string (since strings are immutable).
* Avoids issues with whitespace in validations or comparisons.
* Common in data cleanup tasks in web, backend, and CLI applications.

**Summary:**
`trim()` ensures input strings are clean and free of unwanted spaces. This is critical in real-world applications where user inputs might contain accidental whitespace that could cause bugs or failed validations.

```java
public class TrimDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String rawInput = "  Hello Java  ";
        String trimmed = rawInput.trim();
        System.out.println("Trimmed: '" + trimmed + "'"); // Output: 'Hello Java'
    }
}
```

---

### 76. Fetching Substring from a String

* Use `substring(startIndex)` or `substring(startIndex, endIndex)`.
* Extracts a portion of a string based on index values.
* Common in parsing structured strings (e.g., file names, tokens).
* Indices are zero-based, and the end index is exclusive.
* Throws `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` if indices are invalid.

**Summary:**
`substring()` helps break down and extract parts of strings efficiently. It's used in scenarios like parsing email domains, file extensions, or splitting IDs, and it's foundational in string processing tasks.

```java
public class SubstringDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String email = "john.doe@example.com";
        String domain = email.substring(email.indexOf('@') + 1);
        System.out.println("Email domain: " + domain); // example.com
    }
}
```

---

### 77. Replacing a part of a String

* Use `replace(oldChar, newChar)` or `replaceAll(regex, replacement)`.
* Allows replacing characters or substrings with others.
* Very useful for cleaning data or performing global text changes.
* `replaceAll()` supports regex, giving powerful pattern matching.
* Doesn’t alter the original string (returns a new one).

**Summary:**
Replacing characters or patterns is critical for data transformations, sanitizing inputs, or formatting outputs. Java's `replace()` and `replaceAll()` provide easy ways to handle these changes reliably.

```java
public class ReplaceDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String message = "Java is awesome!";
        String newMessage = message.replace("awesome", "powerful");
        System.out.println(newMessage); // Java is powerful!
    }
}
```

---

### 78. Splitting Strings

* Use `split(delimiter)` to break a string into parts.
* Returns an array of substrings split by the given delimiter.
* Useful for parsing CSVs, logs, or structured input.
* Accepts regex patterns for complex splits.
* Be mindful of escaping characters (e.g., `\\.` for dot).

**Summary:**
Splitting strings is crucial for data extraction and transformation. Java’s `split()` enables dissecting input into manageable chunks, whether you're reading CSVs, parsing logs, or processing commands.

```java
public class SplitDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String csv = "apple,banana,orange";
        String[] fruits = csv.split(",");
        for (String fruit : fruits) {
            System.out.println(fruit);
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 79. \[Java 8] Joining Strings

* Use `String.join(delimiter, elements...)` to concatenate multiple strings.
* It simplifies combining array or list elements with a separator.
* Useful in creating CSV lines, readable lists, or query strings.
* Avoids manual looping and appending.
* Common in APIs, reporting tools, and UI string formatting.

**Summary:**
Joining strings is a frequent task in data formatting and report generation. `String.join()` provides a clean and readable way to concatenate multiple string elements with a chosen delimiter.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class JoinDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String result = String.join("-", "2025", "07", "10");
        System.out.println("Date: " + result); // Date: 2025-07-10

        String list = String.join(", ", Arrays.asList("Java", "Python", "Go"));
        System.out.println("Languages: " + list); // Languages: Java, Python, Go
    }
}
```

Great! Let's continue with the next set of topics with real-world usage, 5-point explanations, summaries, and code at the end of each.

---

### 80. The `format()` Method in String

* `String.format()` formats strings similarly to `printf` in C/C++.
* Allows inserting variables into strings with placeholders like `%s`, `%d`, etc.
* Useful for formatting output, logs, or UI strings consistently.
* Supports number formatting (currency, decimal, percentage, etc.).
* Returns a formatted string instead of printing it.

**Summary:**
`String.format()` gives fine-grained control over string formatting. It’s widely used in logging, user-facing messages, and preparing dynamic content like invoices or reports.

```java
public class FormatDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = "Alice";
        int age = 30;
        String formatted = String.format("Name: %s | Age: %d", name, age);
        System.out.println(formatted); // Output: Name: Alice | Age: 30
    }
}
```

---

### 81. `System.out.printf()` Method

* `System.out.printf()` directly prints formatted strings to the console.
* Similar to `String.format()` but sends output to standard output.
* Helpful for aligned, structured, or tabular console output.
* Avoids extra variables if you just want to display.
* Often used in CLI tools or system messages.

**Summary:**
When quick, clean output is needed, especially for alignment or spacing in terminal apps or debug tools, `System.out.printf()` is a clean and expressive solution.

```java
public class PrintfDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String product = "Laptop";
        double price = 1249.99;
        System.out.printf("Product: %s | Price: $%.2f%n", product, price);
        // Output: Product: Laptop | Price: $1249.99
    }
}
```

---

### 82. Understanding How String Objects Are Immutable

* In Java, `String` objects cannot be changed once created.
* Any modification (e.g., `concat()`, `replace()`) returns a new object.
* Enhances security, thread safety, and caching (string pool).
* Helps prevent accidental data corruption in shared contexts.
* Saves memory via reusability (interning).

**Summary:**
Java’s `String` immutability is foundational for performance and security. In real apps, it ensures consistency in logging, URL building, and key-value systems like databases or caches.

```java
public class ImmutableString {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String original = "Hello";
        String updated = original.concat(" World");

        System.out.println(original); // Hello
        System.out.println(updated);  // Hello World
    }
}
```

---

### 83. How to Create Mutable Strings in Java

* Use `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` to create mutable strings.
* Ideal for scenarios with frequent modifications (e.g., loops, parsing).
* `StringBuilder` is faster but not thread-safe; `StringBuffer` is thread-safe.
* Improves performance by avoiding object creation overhead.
* Common in compilers, dynamic HTML generation, log builders.

**Summary:**
Mutable strings via `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` are performance-friendly in write-intensive tasks. They help reduce garbage collection and boost speed in string-heavy logic.

```java
public class MutableStringDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
        sb.append(" Java").append(" World!");
        System.out.println(sb); // Hello Java World!
    }
}
```

---

### 84. \[Java 15] Text Block in Java

* Text blocks allow multi-line string literals using triple quotes (`"""`).
* Makes it easier to write JSON, HTML, SQL, etc., in readable form.
* Preserves newlines and formatting as written.
* Introduced in Java 15 for cleaner code.
* Reduces need for escape sequences in multi-line strings.

**Summary:**
Text blocks improve readability when dealing with large text-based data like HTML or JSON. They’re especially helpful in REST API testing, SQL queries, or configuration file generation.

```java
public class TextBlockDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String html = """
                <html>
                    <body>
                        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
                    </body>
                </html>
                """;
        System.out.println(html);
    }
}
```

---

Perfect! Let’s continue with the next set (String to primitive conversions and then move into Operators). As before, there are bullet points, a 5-line summary, and the code snippet at the end of each topic.

---

### 85. Converting String to primitive data type values

* Methods like `Integer.parseInt()`, `Double.parseDouble()`, `Boolean.parseBoolean()`, etc., convert strings to primitives.
* Essential for parsing user input, CSV data, or API responses.
* Throws exceptions (e.g., `NumberFormatException`) if the format is invalid.
* Supports different numeric bases via overloads.
* Widely used in data processing, config parsing, and input validation.

**Summary:**
Converting strings to primitives enables reliable handling of numeric or boolean inputs. This is fundamental in real-world scenarios such as reading form data, processing files, or interpreting configurations.

```java
public class ParseDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String sInt = "100";
        String sDouble = "12.34";
        String sBool = "true";

        int i = Integer.parseInt(sInt);
        double d = Double.parseDouble(sDouble);
        boolean b = Boolean.parseBoolean(sBool);

        System.out.println("Int: " + i + ", Double: " + d + ", Bool: " + b);
    }
}
```

---

### 86. Convert String to double data type

* `Double.parseDouble()` converts numeric strings to `double`.
* Useful for financial calculations, sensor input parsing.
* Throws `NumberFormatException` for invalid input.
* Supports scientific notation strings (e.g., "1E3").
* Critical in real-time data visualization and statistical analysis.

**Summary:**
When you're handling floating-point values from text sources—like sensor logs or financial inputs—`Double.parseDouble()` turns string input into usable numeric data for calculations or charting.

```java
public class ParseDoubleDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String reading = "98.76";
        double val = Double.parseDouble(reading);
        double converted = val * 0.453592; // convert mg to mg
        System.out.println("Value in grams: " + converted);
    }
}
```

---

### 87. Introduction to Operators & Operands in Java

* **Operators** are symbols that perform operations (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
* **Operands** are values or variables on which operators act.
* Operators can be unary, binary, or ternary.
* Operate on primitives and return results based on types.
* Foundational to arithmetic, logic, and control-flow operations.

**Summary:**
Understanding operators and operands is vital for basic computations, logic, and control in Java. These building blocks enable everything from arithmetic to conditional logic and are intrinsic to writing effective code.

```java
public class OperatorsDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10, b = 3;
        int sum = a + b;
        int mod = a % b;
        boolean comp = (a > b);
        System.out.printf("sum=%d, mod=%d, a>b=%b%n", sum, mod, comp);
    }
}
```

---

### 88. Assignment Operator in Java

* The `=` operator assigns a value or expression to a variable.
* Evaluates the right-hand side before assignment.
* Chains allowed (e.g., `a = b = c = 10`).
* Works with all assignable data types (primitives or references).
* Common in initialization, updates, and loops.

**Summary:**
The assignment operator is the cornerstone of storing data in variables. Its correct use enables state changes in variables, foundational to any algorithm or process in programming.

```java
public class AssignDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x;
        x = 5;
        int y = x = 7;
        System.out.println("x = " + x + ", y = " + y); // x=7, y=7
    }
}
```

---

### 89. Introduction to Arithmetic Operators in Java

* Include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`—used for calculations.
* Support integer and floating-point arithmetic.
* `%` gives remainder, supporting modulo logic.
* Follow operator precedence—`*`, `/`, `%` evaluated before `+`, `-`.
* Used in real-world tasks like calculations, loops, indexing, and metrics.

**Summary:**
Arithmetic operators power the core of Java programming—from simple calculations to complex mathematical logic. Mastering them is critical for data processing, analytics, and algorithm implementations.

```java
public class ArithmeticDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10, b = 3;
        System.out.println("Sum: " + (a + b));
        System.out.println("Diff: " + (a - b));
        System.out.println("Prod: " + (a * b));
        System.out.println("Quotient: " + (a / b));
        System.out.println("Remainder: " + (a % b));
    }
}
```

---

Here’s the next set of topics including Operators and control structures with real-world code, concise explanation bullets, a 5-line summary, and code at the end:

---

### 90. Addition Operator in Java (`+`)

* Adds two numeric values (int, float, etc.).
* Overloaded for string concatenation as well.
* Evaluates left-to-right, following precedence rules.
* Parentheses can alter the evaluation order.
* Common in calculations, building strings, and increments.

**Summary:**
The `+` operator is essential for arithmetic addition and string-building in Java. It seamlessly handles both numeric sums and string concatenation. Proper precedence and grouping ensure accurate results and prevent logic errors. It's used in nearly every Java application—from financial computations to generating user-friendly messages.

```java
public class AdditionDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 7, b = 8;
        System.out.println("Sum: " + (a + b)); // Sum: 15
        String msg = "Result is " + (a + b);
        System.out.println(msg); // Result is 15
    }
}
```

---

### 91. String Concatenation Operator (`+`)

* Joins string expressions and values neatly.
* Converts non-string operands to string.
* Associativity is left-to-right—grouping matters.
* Handy for building messages or dynamic output.
* Suitable for simple string assembly tasks.

**Summary:**
For straightforward string assembly—like combining variables and text—the `+` operator offers an intuitive approach. However, for more performance-sensitive or complex formatting, `StringBuilder` or `String.format()` may be more appropriate to avoid overhead.

```java
public class ConcatOperatorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String user = "Bob";
        int age = 25;
        String profile = "Name: " + user + ", Age: " + age;
        System.out.println(profile); // Name: Bob, Age: 25
    }
}
```

---

### 92. Division Operator in Java (`/`)

* Performs integer division if both operands are integers (truncates remainder).
* Performs floating-point division if any operand is `float` or `double`.
* Commonly used in calculations, averages, and ratio computations.
* Watch out for division by zero errors at runtime.
* Precision matters: mixing types yields different results.

**Summary:**
The division operator enables both integer and floating-point division, but its behavior differs based on operand types. Understanding the difference prevents bugs around rounding and division-by-zero issues. Widely used in analytics, financial systems, and algorithmic logic.

```java
public class DivisionDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(7 / 2);    // 3
        System.out.println(7.0 / 2);  // 3.5
        // System.out.println(7 / 0); // Throws ArithmeticException
    }
}
```

---

### 93. Modulus Operator in Java (`%`)

* Returns the remainder of integer division.
* Used for parity checks (even/odd), cycles, and hashing.
* Works with decimals too, returning the fractional remainder.
* Handy in timestamp calculations and periodic logic.
* Watch for division by zero runtime errors.

**Summary:**
The modulus operator is invaluable for modular arithmetic, enabling logic like cycling through arrays or checking prime numbers. Its clear usage with integers and floats allows elegant implementations for time-based logic, round-robin tasks, or cleanup validations.

```java
public class ModulusDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 29;
        System.out.println("Even? " + (number % 2 == 0));  // false
        System.out.println("Remainder of 29 / 7 = " + (29 % 7)); // 1
    }
}
```

---

### 94. Unary Plus and Minus Operators

* `+` returns the positive value of a numeric operand (rarely used explicitly).
* `-` negates the numeric value, flipping its sign.
* Applicable only to numeric types.
* Useful in numeric calculations and algorithms (e.g., reversing sign).
* Often seen in complex arithmetic logic or formula translation.

**Summary:**
Unary operators handle sign operations succinctly, with `-` flipping sign and `+` signifying positivity. Though rarely used explicitly, they are handy in mathematical code, transformations, and converting values between positive and negative contexts.

```java
public class UnaryDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int value = 5;
        System.out.println("Negative value: " + -value);  // -5
        int diff = +(-value);
        System.out.println("Result: " + diff);  // -5
    }
}
```

---

### 95. Compound Arithmetic Assignment Operators

* Operators like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, combine operation and assignment.
* Modify the original variable directly.
* Promotes concise code and avoids redundancy.
* Supports arithmetic operators with built-in assignment.
* Useful in loops, accumulators, and incremental logic.

**Summary:**
Compound assignment operators simplify code that performs repeated mathematical operations on a variable. They reduce verbosity and help improve maintainability in iterative contexts like summing arrays or adjusting counters.

```java
public class CompoundAssignDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int count = 10;
        count += 5;  // equivalent to count = count + 5;
        count *= 2;  // equivalent to count = count * 2;
        System.out.println("Count: " + count);  // 30
    }
}
```

---

Great! Let’s continue with the next set of **Java Operators**—covering increment/decrement, relational, and logical operators. As before, each section includes:

* ✅ **5 bullet point explanations**
* 📘 **5-line summary**
* 💻 **Real-world code example placed at the end**

---

### 96. **Increment and Decrement Operators**

* `++` increments a number by 1, `--` decrements it by 1.
* **Prefix (`++i`)** modifies before usage; **Postfix (`i++`)** uses first, then modifies.
* Often used in loops and counter-based logic.
* Common in algorithms involving iteration, pagination, and indexing.
* Easy to misuse when side effects are not well understood.

**Summary:**
Java’s increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators simplify counting and traversal logic. Prefix and postfix forms behave differently in expressions, which is crucial in avoiding logic bugs. They're frequently used in `for` loops and performance-critical code.

```java
public class IncrementDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5;
        int pre = ++a; // a becomes 6, pre is 6
        int post = a++; // post is 6, a becomes 7
        System.out.println("Pre: " + pre + ", Post: " + post + ", a: " + a);
    }
}
```

---

### 97. **Relational Operators**

* Used to compare values: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
* Always return a `boolean` (`true` or `false`).
* Common in conditions, loops, and validations.
* Essential for branching logic and algorithmic comparisons.
* Comparisons follow type conversion rules (int to float etc.).

**Summary:**
Relational operators form the backbone of conditional logic in Java. From comparing numbers to validating inputs, these return boolean results and drive program decisions. Mastery of these is essential for controlling program flow and evaluating conditions.

```java
public class RelationalDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 20;
        System.out.println("Eligible to vote? " + (age >= 18));
    }
}
```

---

### 98. **Equality Operator (`==`)**

* Compares **primitive values** for equality.
* For **objects**, compares memory reference (not content).
* Should not be used for `String` equality—use `.equals()` instead.
* Useful for flags, counters, enums, and constants.
* Very fast and efficient for primitive comparisons.

**Summary:**
The `==` operator checks primitive equality reliably, but caution is needed with objects like Strings, where reference equality may not match content. It’s ideal for comparing numeric values, characters, and enum constants.

```java
public class EqualityDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5, b = 5;
        String s1 = new String("hello");
        String s2 = new String("hello");

        System.out.println(a == b);        // true
        System.out.println(s1 == s2);      // false (different objects)
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true (content match)
    }
}
```

---

### 99. **Inequality Operator (`!=`)**

* Checks if two values or references are **not equal**.
* Opposite of `==`, returns `true` when values differ.
* Also works with booleans, characters, and numerics.
* Common in loops, filters, and mismatch detection.
* Works with both primitives and reference types (object identity).

**Summary:**
The `!=` operator is useful for detecting difference—whether between numbers, flags, or objects. For object references, it checks identity. For meaningful string/content comparisons, combine it with `.equals()` or `!s1.equals(s2)`.

```java
public class NotEqualDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 3, y = 4;
        System.out.println("Different? " + (x != y)); // true
    }
}
```

---

### 100. **Greater Than / Less Than / etc. Operators**

* `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` compare relative magnitude of numbers.
* Only valid with numeric primitive types (or types that implement `Comparable`).
* Commonly used in sorting, filtering, and logic conditions.
* Not valid for `String` unless using `compareTo()` method.
* Part of core conditional expressions in `if` or loops.

**Summary:**
Java’s comparison operators let you build expressions that evaluate order or bounds, such as "greater than 100" or "within range." These are vital in algorithms like binary search, min/max, and decision making.

```java
public class ComparisonDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int price = 150;
        System.out.println("Is price high? " + (price > 100)); // true
    }
}
```

---

Here’s the next batch covering **Logical** and **Bitwise** operators in Java, with real-world context, bullet explanations, concise summaries, and code examples at the end:

---

### 101. Logical AND (`&&`)

* Checks two boolean conditions and short-circuits: if the first is `false`, the second is not evaluated. ([CodeGuru][1], [GeeksforGeeks][2])
* Useful for validating chained conditions, like input correctness and null-safety checks.
* Avoids unnecessary or unsafe evaluations, improving performance and preventing errors.
* Common in scenarios like authentication checks, form validation, and complex control flow.
* Preferred over `&` for logical comparisons due to its short-circuiting nature.

**Summary:**
Logical AND (`&&`) is a short-circuiting operator that only evaluates the second operand if needed, making it efficient for multi-condition checks. Ideal for validations and safe guards, it ensures no unnecessary or risky evaluations occur. Its widespread use in conditions and control flow makes it a staple in Java logic.

```java
public class LogicalAndDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = null;
        if (input != null && input.length() > 5) {
            System.out.println("Valid input: " + input);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid or too short input.");
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 102. Logical OR (`||`)

* Returns `true` if at least one of the conditions is `true`, short-circuiting if the first is `true`. ([upGrad][3], [FreeCodeCamp][4])
* Used for combining default or fallback conditions, such as input defaults or feature flags.
* Helps prevent errors by avoiding unnecessary evaluations, like in resource checks.
* Acts as a guard in control flow for alternate valid paths.
* Cleaner and more efficient compared to nested conditionals or using `|`.

**Summary:**
Logical OR (`||`) offers efficient checking of multiple conditions, stopping evaluation early when possible. It supports fallback logic in validation or feature toggles. Widely used in input handling and conditional flows, it’s a crucial tool for robust, readable code.

```java
public class LogicalOrDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String role = "guest";
        if (role.equals("admin") || role.equals("moderator")) {
            System.out.println("Access granted.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Access denied.");
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 103. Logical NOT (`!`)

* Inverts a boolean expression: `true` becomes `false` and vice versa. ([upGrad][3])
* Useful for checking inverse conditions, like failure or invalid states.
* Improves code clarity by expressing negative logic directly.
* Common in loop conditions, flag-based logic, and validation checks.
* Helps simplify boolean logic alongside AND/OR combinations.

**Summary:**
Logical NOT (`!`) flips boolean values, enabling concise expression of negative conditions. It's frequently used in validations and logic flow controls. When combined with other logical operators, it helps maintain clarity and clean decision-making structures.

```java
public class LogicalNotDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean loggedIn = false;
        if (!loggedIn) {
            System.out.println("Please log in first.");
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 104. Bitwise Operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`)

* Operate at the bit level for integer types, enabling low-level data manipulation.
* `&`, `|`, `^` perform bitwise AND, OR, and XOR; shifts (<<, >>, >>>) change bit positions.
* Common in permission checks, feature flags, and hardware interfacing. ([Reddit][5], [upGrad][3], [Javatpoint][6], [Intellipaat][7], [Wikipedia][8])
* XOR is used in lightweight encryption or bit toggling scenarios.
* Shifts efficiently multiply or divide by powers of two, used in performance-critical code.

**Summary:**
Bitwise operators let you work directly on individual bits for compact data representation, performance tuning, and hardware-closest operations. Their real-world uses include file permissions, feature flags, encryption, and graphics programming. Mastering these operators is key for systems-level or high-performance tasks.

```java
public class BitwiseDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int flags = 0;
        final int READ = 1;  // 001
        final int WRITE = 2; // 010
        final int EXECUTE = 4; // 100

        flags |= READ | WRITE; // set read and write
        boolean canRead = (flags & READ) == READ;
        boolean canExecute = (flags & EXECUTE) == EXECUTE;

        System.out.println("Can read: " + canRead);       // true
        System.out.println("Can execute: " + canExecute); // false
    }
}
```

---

### 105. Short-Circuit vs Bitwise Logical (`&&` vs `&` / `||` vs `|`)

* `&&` and `||` are short-circuiting logical operators; `&` and `|` always evaluate both operands. ([Shiksha][9], [upGrad][3])
* Use `&` and `|` when both conditions need guarantee evaluation (e.g., logging, side-effects).
* Short-circuit helps performance and avoids unnecessary computation or exceptions.
* Operator precedence: bitwise ops (`&`, `|`) have lower precedence than relational, but higher than `&&`, `||`.&#x20;
* Best practice: generally prefer `&&`/`||`, use `&`/`|` for specific scenarios.

**Summary:**
Short-circuit operators (`&&`, `||`) provide safe, efficient evaluation, stopping when results are predictable. Non-short-circuit operators (`&`, `|`) evaluate all operands and are useful when both sides must run. Understanding their precedence and behavior is critical for predictable and performant logic.

```java
public class ShortCircuitDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 0;
        if ((a == 1) && (++a == 2)) {
            // second side not evaluated
        }
        System.out.println("After &&: a = " + a); // a remains 0

        a = 0;
        if ((a == 1) & (++a == 1)) {
            // both evaluated
        }
        System.out.println("After &: a = " + a); // a becomes 1
    }
}
```

Excellent! Next up: **Ternary/Conditional Operator** and **Operator Precedence & Associativity**. 🎯

---

### 106. Ternary or Conditional Operator (`? :`)

* A shorthand for simple `if-else` that returns one of two values.
* Format: `condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse`.
* Ideal for inline assignments, concise code, and avoiding multi-line `if-else`.
* Evaluates only relevant branch—efficient and clean.
* Great for setting defaults, UI strings, and logging.

**Summary:**
The ternary operator simplifies conditional assignments by embedding logic within expressions. Perfect for initializing variables or formatting messages without verbose control structures. Its use supports cleaner, maintainable code when used for simple conditions.

```java
public class TernaryDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int score = 85;
        String grade = (score >= 90) ? "A" :
                       (score >= 75) ? "B" : "C";
        System.out.println("Grade: " + grade); // B
    }
}
```

### 107. Operator Precedence & Associativity

* Determines order of evaluation for compound expressions.
* e.g., `*`/`/` higher priority than `+`/`-`; `==` vs. `&&` etc.
* Associativity (left-to-right or right-to-left) defines order when operators share same precedence.
* Parentheses can override default rules for clarity.
* Misunderstanding precedence can introduce subtle bugs.

**Summary:**
Understanding operator precedence and associativity is crucial to avoid logic errors in complex expressions. When unclear, use parentheses to ensure correct order. This knowledge underpins predictable behavior in all Java expressions, from math to boolean logic.

```java
public class PrecedenceDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = 3 + 4 * 2;      // 3 + (4*2) = 11
        int x = 5, y = 10, z = 15;
        boolean flag = x < y && y < z;  // true
        System.out.println("result: " + result + ", flag: " + flag);
    }
}
```

Great! Let’s move into **Control Flow Statements**, starting with **`if`, `else if`, `else` statements** in Java.

---

### 108. Deep Dive on `if`, `else if`, `else` Statements in Java

* These are used to conditionally execute blocks of code based on boolean expressions.
* `if` evaluates a condition; `else if` checks another condition if the first fails.
* `else` runs when none of the previous conditions match.
* Perfect for decision-making logic like user access control, pricing, or form validation.
* Helps control the flow of execution based on different program states.

**Summary:**
`if-else` statements are core to Java’s control flow and decision-making. They allow programs to execute different paths depending on varying inputs or conditions. This structure is foundational for writing responsive, logic-based programs.

```java
public class IfElseDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 20;

        if (age < 13) {
            System.out.println("Child");
        } else if (age < 20) {
            System.out.println("Teenager");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Adult");
        }
    }
}
```

---

Great! Let's move on to the next topic in control flow:

---

### 109. **Nested `if-else if-else` Statements**

* A nested `if` is an `if` statement inside another `if` or `else` block.
* It's useful when multiple levels of conditions must be checked in a structured order.
* Helps in handling complex decision logic like eligibility checks or multi-tier access systems.
* Each condition block can independently contain further decision-making.
* Readability is key—avoid too deep nesting to prevent confusion.

**Summary:**
Nested `if-else` statements enable developers to implement multi-level condition checking. This structure is helpful in real-world systems where decisions depend on multiple parameters. However, too much nesting should be avoided to maintain clean, readable code.

```java
public class NestedIfElseDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int marks = 85;
        String grade;

        if (marks >= 90) {
            grade = "A+";
        } else if (marks >= 80) {
            if (marks >= 85) {
                grade = "A";
            } else {
                grade = "B+";
            }
        } else {
            grade = "B";
        }

        System.out.println("Grade: " + grade);
    }
}
```

### 111. Deep Dive on Switch Case Statement

* Switch simplifies multi-way branching based on a single variable.
* Supports primitive types (int, char), enums, and strings.
* Enhances readability over multiple `if-else-if` statements.
* Used in menu-driven programs, state machines, and protocol handling.
* Default case handles unexpected or fallback scenarios.

**Summary:**
Switch statements are a cleaner way to implement decision-making logic when there are multiple possible values of a single expression. It improves code clarity and efficiency, commonly applied in command parsing or selection menus.

```java
public class SwitchDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int day = 3;
        String dayName;
        switch (day) {
            case 1: dayName = "Monday"; break;
            case 2: dayName = "Tuesday"; break;
            case 3: dayName = "Wednesday"; break;
            case 4: dayName = "Thursday"; break;
            case 5: dayName = "Friday"; break;
            default: dayName = "Weekend"; break;
        }
        System.out.println("Day is: " + dayName);
    }
}
```

---

### 112. \[JAVA 14] Deep Dive on Switch Expression

* Java 14 introduces switch as an expression returning values.
* Uses `->` arrow syntax for concise cases.
* Supports multiple labels per case using commas.
* Eliminates need for explicit `break` statements.
* Ideal for cleaner and more expressive code logic.

**Summary:**
Switch expressions in Java 14 make switch statements more concise and less error-prone by returning values directly. This helps avoid common pitfalls like forgetting breaks and allows more compact syntax.

```java
public class SwitchExpressionDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int day = 4;
        String dayName = switch (day) {
            case 1, 2, 3 -> "Weekday";
            case 4, 5 -> "Almost weekend";
            case 6, 7 -> "Weekend";
            default -> "Invalid day";
        };
        System.out.println(dayName);
    }
}
```

---

### 113. Deep Dive on While Statement

* Executes a block repeatedly as long as the condition is true.
* Condition is checked before each iteration (pre-check loop).
* Useful for reading data until a condition changes.
* Employed in input validation, polling, or waiting for events.
* Can cause infinite loops if condition is never false.

**Summary:**
The `while` loop allows repetitive execution based on a condition, ideal for scenarios where the number of iterations is unknown beforehand. It's widely used for continuous input reading or waiting for external events.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class WhileDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int number;
        do {
            System.out.print("Enter positive number (0 to exit): ");
            number = scanner.nextInt();
            System.out.println("You entered: " + number);
        } while (number != 0);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

---

### 114. Deep Dive on Do While Statement

* Executes the loop body at least once (post-check loop).
* Condition is checked after executing the block.
* Useful when the loop must run at least one time.
* Often used for menus or repeating prompts until valid input.
* Less common but important for guaranteed first iteration logic.

**Summary:**
`do-while` loops guarantee the body runs at least once, making them suitable for user interaction scenarios where prompt appears before any condition check.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class DoWhileDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int choice;
        do {
            System.out.println("1. Continue");
            System.out.println("0. Exit");
            System.out.print("Enter choice: ");
            choice = scanner.nextInt();
        } while (choice != 0);
        scanner.close();
        System.out.println("Exited.");
    }
}
```

---

### 115. Deep Dive on For Loop

* Common loop for iterating with initialization, condition, and update.
* Best when number of iterations is known.
* Used extensively in processing arrays, collections, or repetitive tasks.
* Easy to control iteration variables.
* Can nest for complex multi-level iterations.

**Summary:**
The `for` loop is ideal when you know in advance how many times you want to iterate, making it the workhorse for array processing, repeated calculations, and batch operations.

```java
public class ForLoopDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Count: " + i);
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 116. Deep Dive on Nested For Loops

* For loops placed inside other for loops.
* Useful for iterating multi-dimensional data like 2D arrays.
* Enables matrix operations, pattern printing, and grid traversals.
* Can be computationally expensive if not used carefully.
* Common in algorithms involving pairs or triplets of elements.

**Summary:**
Nested loops allow traversal of multi-level data structures or solving problems requiring multiple dimensions, such as matrix processing or nested lists.

```java
public class NestedForLoopDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= 2; j++) {
                System.out.println("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 117. Break Statement

* Used to exit loops or switch statements immediately.
* Helps prevent unnecessary iterations.
* Useful in search algorithms where match found early.
* Can improve efficiency by stopping loops when condition met.
* Should be used carefully to avoid confusing flow control.

**Summary:**
`break` statements allow early exit from loops or switches, optimizing performance and logic clarity, especially when continuing is pointless after a condition is met.

```java
public class BreakDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            if (i == 5) {
                System.out.println("Breaking at i = " + i);
                break;
            }
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 118. Continue Statement

* Skips the current iteration and proceeds with the next loop cycle.
* Useful to skip invalid or unwanted values.
* Helps keep loop logic clean by avoiding nested `if` blocks.
* Common in filtering or skipping specific data during iteration.
* Works only inside loops, not switch or if statements.

**Summary:**
The `continue` statement skips the remainder of the loop body for the current iteration, useful to filter or skip processing certain cases inside loops without breaking the whole loop.

```java
public class ContinueDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            if (i == 3) {
                System.out.println("Skipping " + i);
                continue;
            }
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 119. Return Statement

* Exits from a method and optionally returns a value.
* Controls the flow in methods, allowing early exit.
* Used to pass results back to the caller.
* Can be used multiple times in a method for different outcomes.
* Important for recursion base cases.

**Summary:**
The `return` statement controls method exit and data passing, crucial for breaking out early, returning computed results, or terminating recursive calls.

```java
public class ReturnDemo {
    public static int square(int x) {
        return x * x;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = square(5);
        System.out.println("Square of 5 is " + result);
    }
}
```

---

### 120. Local Variables & Scope

* Variables declared inside methods or blocks.
* Visible only within the block they are declared.
* Helps avoid unintended side effects by limiting variable access.
* Each method invocation gets its own copy of local variables.
* Prevents conflicts with variables of the same name elsewhere.

**Summary:**
Local variables hold temporary data inside methods or blocks and have limited visibility, helping maintain clean, modular, and bug-free code by restricting scope.

```java
public class LocalVariableDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 10;  // local variable
        {
            int numberInsideBlock = 20;  // scoped inside block
            System.out.println("Inside block: " + numberInsideBlock);
        }
        System.out.println("Outside block: " + number);
    }
}
```

### 121. Introduction to Packages & Benefits of Them

* Packages group related classes and interfaces for modular code organization.
* Helps avoid naming conflicts by providing namespace management.
* Improves code maintainability and readability.
* Enables access control through package-private visibility.
* Facilitates code reuse and modular project structure.

**Summary:**
Packages help organize Java classes into namespaces, making large projects manageable by grouping related functionality, avoiding name clashes, and controlling access.

```java
// Package declaration
package com.example.utils;

public class MathUtils {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

---

### 122. Creating a Package

* Define package at the top of a Java file using `package` keyword.
* Package name usually follows reverse domain name convention.
* Classes inside package are stored in corresponding folder structure.
* Enables importing of classes from other packages.
* Required for better modular project design.

**Summary:**
Creating a package involves declaring the package name in your Java files, organizing files in matching directories, and facilitating modular and reusable code.

```java
package com.example.shapes;

public class Circle {
    public double radius;
    
    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }
}
```

---

### 123. Rules & Standards to Name a Package

* Package names are lowercase to avoid conflicts.
* Use reverse domain name to ensure uniqueness (e.g., com.company.project).
* Use only letters, numbers, and underscores.
* Avoid Java reserved keywords.
* Use descriptive names for clarity.

**Summary:**
Naming packages follows conventions to ensure uniqueness and clarity, using lowercase letters and domain-based names to avoid collisions in large projects.

```java
package com.mycompany.myproject.utilities;
```

---

### 124. Using Package Members with Import Statement

* `import` allows using classes from other packages without fully qualifying names.
* Can import individual classes or whole packages using `*`.
* Reduces verbosity and improves code readability.
* Static import enables accessing static members directly.
* Essential for modular code using multiple packages.

**Summary:**
The import statement is used to bring external package classes into your code, making it easier to reference them without typing full package names every time.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ImportDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}
```

---

### 125. The Great java.lang Package

* Automatically imported by default.
* Contains fundamental classes like `String`, `System`, `Math`, `Thread`, `Object`.
* Provides basic utilities needed in almost every Java program.
* No need to manually import classes from java.lang.
* Essential for Java program foundation.

**Summary:**
The `java.lang` package is the core of Java’s standard library, always available without imports, and includes essential classes for everyday programming.

```java
public class JavaLangDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String message = "Hello, World!";
        System.out.println(message.toUpperCase());
    }
}
```

### 126. The Static Import Statements

* Allows importing static members (fields/methods) directly.
* Makes code concise by removing class name prefix.
* Useful for constants or utility methods (e.g., `Math.PI`).
* Can import all static members with `import static pkg.Class.*`.
* Should be used judiciously to avoid code confusion.

**Summary:**
Static imports simplify access to static members by allowing direct usage without class names, improving readability in specific contexts like math constants or utilities.

```java
import static java.lang.Math.PI;
import static java.lang.Math.sqrt;

public class StaticImportDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double radius = 5;
        double area = PI * radius * radius;
        double root = sqrt(16);
        System.out.println("Area: " + area + ", Square root: " + root);
    }
}
```

---

### 127. Important Points About Packages & Imports

* Packages group classes and provide namespace management.
* Import statements ease usage of classes from other packages.
* Fully qualified names can be used without imports but are verbose.
* Circular dependencies among packages are not allowed.
* Package access modifiers control visibility between packages.

**Summary:**
Understanding packages and imports is key to structuring Java projects, managing namespaces, and controlling access while writing maintainable and scalable code.

```java
package com.example.test;

import com.example.utils.MathUtils;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(MathUtils.add(10, 20));
    }
}
```

---

### 128. Introduction to Access Modifiers

* Control visibility of classes, methods, and variables.
* Four types: `public`, `protected`, `default` (package-private), `private`.
* `public` is visible everywhere.
* `private` restricts access within the class only.
* `protected` accessible within package and subclasses.

**Summary:**
Access modifiers safeguard data and functionality by restricting access to classes or members, providing encapsulation and security.

```java
public class AccessDemo {
    private int secret = 42;
    protected int familyValue = 10;
    int defaultValue = 5;  // package-private
    public int publicValue = 100;
}
```

---

### 129. Demo of Access Modifiers for Java Classes

* Top-level classes can only be `public` or default (package-private).
* `public` classes accessible from anywhere.
* Default classes accessible only within the package.
* Helps encapsulate internal implementation.
* Often used to hide helper classes from API users.

**Summary:**
Java classes can be public for external access or package-private to limit visibility, enforcing modular design and hiding internals.

```java
// File: com/example/ExampleClass.java
package com.example;

public class PublicClass {
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Public Class");
    }
}

class PackagePrivateClass {
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Package Private Class");
    }
}
```

---

### 130. Demo of Access Modifiers for Methods, Fields in Classes

* Methods and fields can have any access modifier.
* `private` hides fields/methods completely from outside classes.
* `public` exposes them to all classes.
* `protected` allows subclasses and package classes access.
* Package-private (default) accessible within the same package only.

**Summary:**
Access modifiers on members define who can see or use methods and variables, crucial for encapsulation and API design.

```java
public class MemberAccessDemo {
    private int secret = 100;
    protected int familyValue = 200;
    int defaultValue = 300;  // package-private
    public int publicValue = 400;
    
    private void privateMethod() {
        System.out.println("Private method");
    }
    
    public void publicMethod() {
        System.out.println("Public method");
    }
}
```

### 131. Deep Dive on POJO Classes

* POJO: Plain Old Java Object, simple class without special restrictions.
* Used to model data with private fields and public getters/setters.
* No inheritance or annotations required.
* Commonly used for data transfer objects (DTOs).
* Enhances readability and maintainability.

**Summary:**
POJO classes are simple Java classes designed to hold data, typically with private fields and public getters/setters, making them perfect for clean data modeling.

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person() {}

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() { return name; }
    public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }

    public int getAge() { return age; }
    public void setAge(int age) { this.age = age; }
}
```

---

### 132. Introduction to Inheritance in Java

* Enables a new class (subclass) to inherit properties/methods from a parent class.
* Supports code reuse and method overriding.
* Represents “is-a” relationship.
* Helps create hierarchical class structures.
* Promotes polymorphism.

**Summary:**
Inheritance allows one class to reuse and extend another’s functionality, enabling hierarchical designs and code reuse, fundamental to OOP.

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() { System.out.println("Eating"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() { System.out.println("Barking"); }
}
```

---

### 133. Object Class is the Default Superclass

* Every Java class implicitly inherits from `java.lang.Object`.
* Provides fundamental methods like `toString()`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`.
* Allows polymorphism and method overriding.
* Classes inherit default behavior from Object.
* Forms root of all class hierarchies.

**Summary:**
All Java classes derive from the `Object` class, inheriting core methods and enabling polymorphism by default.

```java
class Custom {
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Custom toString() method";
    }
}
```

---

### 134. is-a & has-a Relationships in Java

* **is-a**: inheritance (Dog is-a Animal).
* **has-a**: composition/aggregation (Car has-a Engine).
* Facilitates design clarity.
* Supports reusability and modularity.
* Helps define object relationships.

**Summary:**
Understanding “is-a” (inheritance) and “has-a” (composition) relationships guides object-oriented design and helps build flexible, maintainable code.

```java
class Engine { }

class Car {
    private Engine engine;  // has-a relationship
}
```

---

### 135. What a Subclass Inherits from its Superclass

* Inherits accessible fields and methods (public/protected/package-private).
* Does NOT inherit constructors.
* Can override inherited methods.
* Cannot access private members directly.
* Inherits static members but cannot override them.

**Summary:**
A subclass inherits non-private members and can override methods, enabling extension and customization of base class behavior.

```java
class Parent {
    public void show() { System.out.println("Parent show"); }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    public void show() { System.out.println("Child show"); }
}
```

---

### 136. Introduction to Upcasting in Java

* Casting subclass object to superclass type.
* Enables polymorphism.
* Safe and implicit.
* Limits access to superclass methods only.
* Used in method parameters and collections.

**Summary:**
Upcasting treats subclass objects as superclass types, allowing polymorphism and uniform handling of related objects.

```java
Dog dog = new Dog();
Animal animal = dog;  // upcasting
animal.eat();
```

---

### 137. Introduction to Downcasting & its Demo

* Casting superclass reference back to subclass type.
* Needs explicit cast and is unsafe if incorrect.
* Enables access to subclass-specific methods.
* Throws `ClassCastException` if invalid.
* Used when specific subclass behavior is needed.

**Summary:**
Downcasting converts superclass references back to subclasses to access subclass methods but must be done carefully with type checks.

```java
Animal animal = new Dog();
Dog dog = (Dog) animal;  // downcasting
dog.bark();
```

---

### 138. instanceof Operator

* Tests if an object is an instance of a specific class or interface.
* Helps avoid invalid downcasting.
* Returns boolean.
* Useful in polymorphic code.
* Supports safe type checks.

**Summary:**
The `instanceof` operator ensures safe casting by checking the actual object type before downcasting.

```java
if (animal instanceof Dog) {
    Dog dog = (Dog) animal;
    dog.bark();
}
```

---

### 139. Static Binding and Dynamic Binding in Java

* Static binding: compile-time method binding (for static, private, final methods).
* Dynamic binding: runtime method dispatch (for overridden methods).
* Enables polymorphism.
* Improves flexibility and extensibility.
* Key to Java's runtime behavior.

**Summary:**
Static binding resolves methods at compile time; dynamic binding resolves overridden methods at runtime, supporting polymorphism.

```java
class Parent {
    void show() { System.out.println("Parent show"); }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void show() { System.out.println("Child show"); }
}

Parent p = new Child();
p.show();  // dynamic binding calls Child’s show()
```

---

### 140. What is Polymorphism in Java

* Ability of an object to take many forms.
* Achieved via method overriding and interfaces.
* Enables dynamic method invocation.
* Improves code flexibility and reusability.
* Core OOP principle.

**Summary:**
Polymorphism lets one interface represent different underlying forms, allowing flexible and extensible program designs.

```java
Animal a = new Dog();
a.eat();  // calls Dog's eat()
```

---

### 141. Method Overriding

* Subclass provides specific implementation of superclass method.
* Runtime polymorphism enabled.
* Method signature must be the same.
* `@Override` annotation recommended.
* Access level cannot be more restrictive.

**Summary:**
Method overriding allows subclasses to change or extend behavior of inherited methods, enabling polymorphism.

```java
@Override
public void eat() {
    System.out.println("Dog eats bones");
}
```

---

### 142. super Keyword to Invoke Superclass Methods from Subclass

* Refers to parent class object.
* Used to call superclass methods overridden in subclass.
* Can access superclass constructors.
* Helps reuse superclass functionality.
* Useful in constructor chaining.

**Summary:**
The `super` keyword accesses superclass methods or constructors from subclass, aiding code reuse and proper inheritance structure.

```java
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void eat() {
        super.eat();
        System.out.println("Dog eats bones");
    }
}
```

---

### 143. Method Overloading

* Multiple methods with same name but different parameters.
* Compile-time polymorphism.
* Improves readability and flexibility.
* Can vary parameter type, number, or order.
* Return type can differ but doesn’t affect overloading.

**Summary:**
Method overloading allows defining multiple methods with same name but different parameters for better code clarity and reusability.

```java
void print(int a) { }
void print(String s) { }
```

---

### 144. Method Overriding vs Method Overloading

| Feature          | Overriding               | Overloading  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| Polymorphism     | Runtime                  | Compile-time |
| Same method name | Yes                      | Yes          |
| Parameters       | Same                     | Different    |
| Return type      | Same (covariant allowed) | Can differ   |
| Inheritance      | Required                 | Not required |

**Summary:**
Overriding changes inherited behavior at runtime, while overloading offers multiple method variants with same name but different parameters.

---

### 145. Method Hiding in Java Inheritance

* Static methods can be hidden, not overridden.
* Reference type determines which static method is called.
* Different from instance method overriding.
* Does not support polymorphism.
* Can cause confusion if not understood.

**Summary:**
Static methods are hidden in subclasses, resolved by reference type at compile-time, unlike overridden instance methods.

```java
class Parent {
    static void display() { System.out.println("Parent"); }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    static void display() { System.out.println("Child"); }
}

Parent p = new Child();
p.display();  // calls Parent's display()
```

---

### 146. Field Hiding in Java Inheritance

* Subclass can declare a field with same name as superclass.
* Field accessed depends on reference type, not object type.
* Hides superclass field.
* Different from method overriding.
* Leads to confusing code, use carefully.

**Summary:**
Field hiding means subclass defines a field with same name as superclass, but reference type controls field access, not runtime object type.

```java
class Parent {
    int value = 10;
}

class Child extends Parent {
    int value = 20;
}

Parent p = new Child();
System.out.println(p.value);  // prints 10
```

---

### 147. The Story of Constructors & Inheritance Together

* Constructors not inherited but invoked via `super()`.
* Default constructor added by compiler if none provided.
* Subclass constructor calls superclass constructor implicitly.
* Allows proper initialization chain.
* Constructor chaining ensures superclass parts initialized first.

**Summary:**
Constructors initialize objects in inheritance; subclass constructors invoke superclass constructors ensuring complete object setup.

```java
class Parent {
    Parent() { System.out.println("Parent constructor"); }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    Child() { System.out.println("Child constructor"); }
}
```

---

### 148. this and super Keywords in Java

* `this` refers to current class instance.
* `super` refers to superclass instance.
* `this()` invokes current class constructor.
* `super()` invokes superclass constructor.
* Used to distinguish variables or methods.

**Summary:**
`this` and `super` help manage references to current and parent class objects and constructors for clear and maintainable code.

```java
class A {
    int x;
    A(int x) { this.x = x; }
}

class B extends A {
    B(int x) { super(x); }
}
```

---

### 149. Types of Inheritance in Java

* Single inheritance: one class inherits from one class.
* Multilevel inheritance: class inherits from subclass.
* Hierarchical inheritance: multiple subclasses inherit from one superclass.
* Multiple inheritance via interfaces only.
* Supports code reuse and polymorphism.

**Summary:**
Java supports various inheritance types to build flexible class hierarchies, except multiple inheritance through classes which is replaced by interfaces.

```java
class A {}
class B extends A {}
class C extends B {}
```

---

### 150. Abstract Methods and Classes

* Abstract class cannot be instantiated.
* Contains abstract methods without body.
* Subclasses must implement abstract methods.
* Can have non-abstract methods.
* Used to define templates.

**Summary:**
Abstract classes provide a blueprint with unimplemented methods forcing subclasses to provide behavior, enabling abstraction in design.

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();
    void eat() { System.out.println("Eating"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Bark"); }

### 151. Interface vs Abstract Class

* **Abstract class:** Can have both abstract & concrete methods, state (fields), constructors, supports code reuse.
* **Interface:** Only abstract methods (Java 8+ allows default/static methods), no state (except constants), multiple inheritance support.
* Used for different purposes — abstract class for “is-a” relationship with shared code; interface for contract.

**Summary:**
Abstract classes provide partial implementation and state, while interfaces define a contract for behavior without state, enabling multiple inheritance.

```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void move();
    void start() { System.out.println("Vehicle started"); }
}

interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

class Plane extends Vehicle implements Flyable {
    void move() { System.out.println("Plane moves"); }
    public void fly() { System.out.println("Plane flies"); }
}
```

### 152. Default and Static Methods in Interfaces (Java 8+)

* Interfaces can have `default` methods with body to provide default implementation.
* Can also have `static` methods callable on the interface itself.
* Helps add new methods without breaking existing implementations.
* Supports backward compatibility.

**Summary:**
Java 8 introduced default and static methods in interfaces, allowing method implementations directly in interfaces for flexible evolution.

```java
interface MyInterface {
    default void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("Default method");
    }
    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Static method");
    }
}
```

### 153. Marker Interface in Java

* Interface with no methods.
* Used to provide metadata or signal to JVM/compiler.
* Example: `Serializable`, `Cloneable`.
* Enables special processing or behavior at runtime.
* Acts as a tagging mechanism.

**Summary:**
Marker interfaces are empty interfaces used to tag classes for special behavior by frameworks or JVM.

```java
class MyClass implements java.io.Serializable {
    // Class can be serialized because of this marker interface
}
```

---

### 154. Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions

* Functional Interface: Interface with single abstract method.
* Can be implemented using Lambda expressions.
* Simplifies anonymous class usage.
* Java 8 feature, used extensively in streams and concurrency.
* Annotated with `@FunctionalInterface`.

**Summary:**
Functional interfaces enable concise function representations with lambdas, making code cleaner and more expressive.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Calculator {
    int calculate(int a, int b);
}

Calculator add = (a, b) -> a + b;
System.out.println(add.calculate(5, 3));
```

---

### 155. Method References in Java 8

* Shorthand notation for lambda expressions.
* Use `ClassName::methodName` syntax.
* Improves readability.
* Can reference static, instance, or constructor methods.
* Commonly used with streams.

**Summary:**
Method references provide a cleaner way to express lambdas by directly referring to existing methods.

```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c");
list.forEach(System.out::println);
```

---

### 156. Inner Classes and Types

* Classes defined inside another class.
* Types: static nested, non-static inner, local inner, anonymous inner.
* Inner classes have access to outer class members.
* Used to logically group classes and hide implementation details.
* Improve encapsulation.

**Summary:**
Inner classes allow defining classes inside other classes to logically group code and access outer class members.

```java
class Outer {
    class Inner {
        void display() { System.out.println("Inner class"); }
    }
}
```

---

### 157. Anonymous Inner Classes

* Inner class without a name.
* Used to override methods or implement interfaces on the fly.
* Often used with event listeners or callbacks.
* Makes code concise without separate class files.
* Cannot have constructors.

**Summary:**
Anonymous inner classes enable quick implementation of interfaces or subclasses inline, reducing boilerplate code.

```java
Runnable r = new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running anonymously");
    }
};
new Thread(r).start();
```

---

### 158. Lambda vs Anonymous Inner Classes

* Lambdas are more concise, introduced in Java 8.
* Anonymous classes can have multiple methods, lambdas cannot.
* Lambdas only for functional interfaces.
* Lambdas capture variables effectively final.
* Better readability and less boilerplate.

**Summary:**
Lambdas provide a shorter, cleaner alternative to anonymous inner classes for single-method interfaces.

```java
Runnable r1 = () -> System.out.println("Lambda");
Runnable r2 = new Runnable() {
    public void run() { System.out.println("Anonymous class"); }
};
```

---

### 159. Enumeration (enum) in Java

* Special class to define fixed set of constants.
* Can have fields, methods, constructors.
* Type-safe and readable.
* Used for representing predefined values.
* Supports switch statements.

**Summary:**
Enums provide a typesafe way to represent constant sets with associated behavior.

```java
enum Day { MON, TUE, WED }

Day today = Day.MON;
```

---

### 160. Generics in Java

* Enable type-safe collections and methods.
* Provide compile-time type checking.
* Avoids casting and ClassCastException.
* Uses type parameters (e.g., `<T>`).
* Widely used in Collections API.

**Summary:**
Generics provide stronger type checks at compile time, reducing runtime errors and eliminating casts.

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Hello");
String s = list.get(0);
```

---

### 161. Wildcards in Generics (`?`)

* Represents unknown type.
* Used in method parameters.
* Supports covariance (`? extends T`) and contravariance (`? super T`).
* Controls what types are accepted.
* Improves API flexibility.

**Summary:**
Wildcards in generics allow flexible and safe usage of parameterized types with unknown or bounded types.

```java
void process(List<? extends Number> list) { }
```

---

### 162. Bounded Type Parameters in Generics

* Restrict type parameters to subclasses/supertypes.
* Syntax: `<T extends Number>`.
* Ensures type safety with specific class hierarchy.
* Allows calling methods of the bounded type.
* Useful for algorithms working on specific types.

**Summary:**
Bounded type parameters limit generics to specific types, enabling safe and expressive code.

```java
<T extends Number> void display(T number) {
    System.out.println(number);
}
```

---

### 163. Generic Methods

* Methods with their own type parameters.
* Independent of class-level generics.
* Enables generic behavior in any method.
* Type inferred automatically.
* Improves method reusability.

**Summary:**
Generic methods allow parameterizing types locally for flexible and reusable code.

```java
public <T> void printArray(T[] array) {
    for (T element : array) System.out.println(element);
}
```

---

### 164. Type Erasure in Generics

* Generics implemented by compiler removing type info at runtime.
* Ensures backward compatibility.
* Causes inability to check generic types at runtime.
* Can lead to warnings.
* Important to understand when dealing with reflection or casts.

**Summary:**
Type erasure removes generic type information at runtime, meaning generics exist only at compile time.

---

### 165. Collections Framework Overview

* Provides data structures like List, Set, Map, Queue.
* Standardized API for collection manipulation.
* Supports algorithms like sorting, searching.
* Classes: ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, LinkedList, etc.
* Improves productivity and performance.

**Summary:**
Java Collections Framework offers a set of interfaces and classes to store and manipulate groups of objects efficiently.

---

### 166. List Interface and ArrayList Class

* `List` allows ordered collection with duplicates.
* ArrayList is resizable array implementation.
* Fast random access, slower insert/delete at middle.
* Methods: add, remove, get, size.
* Frequently used for dynamic arrays.

**Summary:**
List interface represents ordered collections, and ArrayList provides a flexible, resizable array implementation.

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Java");
System.out.println(list.get(0));
```

---

### 167. LinkedList Class in Java

* Implements List and Deque interfaces.
* Doubly linked list data structure.
* Faster insert/delete at both ends.
* Slower random access than ArrayList.
* Useful for queues and stacks.

**Summary:**
LinkedList provides efficient insert/delete at ends and supports list and deque operations.

```java
LinkedList<String> linkedList = new LinkedList<>();
linkedList.add("Node");
System.out.println(linkedList.getFirst());
```

---

### 168. Set Interface and HashSet Class

* `Set` stores unique elements, no duplicates.
* HashSet uses hash table, unordered.
* Fast add, remove, contains.
* Null allowed.
* Useful for uniqueness checks.

**Summary:**
Set interface models unique collections; HashSet implements it with fast, unordered access.

```java
Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
set.add(10);
set.add(10);  // duplicate ignored
```

---

### 169. TreeSet Class in Java

* Implements SortedSet interface.
* Elements stored in sorted order (natural or comparator).
* Uses Red-Black tree internally.
* No duplicates allowed.
* Useful for sorted unique elements.

**Summary:**
TreeSet maintains sorted unique elements using a self-balancing tree structure.

```java
TreeSet<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
treeSet.add("b");
treeSet.add("a");
System.out.println(treeSet.first());  // outputs "a"
```

---

### 170. Map Interface and HashMap Class

* `Map` stores key-value pairs.
* HashMap uses hashing, allows null keys/values.
* Fast lookup, insert, delete.
* No ordering guaranteed.
* Useful for dictionary-like structures.

**Summary:**
Map interface models key-value mappings; HashMap provides an efficient, unordered implementation.

```java
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("one", 1);
System.out.println(map.get("one"));
```
