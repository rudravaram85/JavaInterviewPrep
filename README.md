Here‚Äôs **Section 2: Primitive Data Types in Java**, with real-time coding examples, bullet-point explanations, summaries, and interview Q\&A for each part:

---

## 1. Introduction to Java Keywords

### üîç Explanation

* Reserved words with specific meanings in Java and cannot be used as identifiers.
* Includes types (`int`, `char`), control (`if`, `for`), modifiers (`public`, `static`), etc.
* Helps compiler parse code structure and enforce language rules.
* There are around 50 keywords in Java today.
* New keywords may be added in evolving versions (e.g., `var` in Java 10).

### ‚úÖ Summary

Java keywords form the language‚Äôs foundation by defining structure, flow, and behavior. They‚Äôre non-negotiable ‚Äî you must use them correctly, as they‚Äôre reserved and non-redefinable. As Java evolves, it may introduce new ones, further extending its syntax.

```java
public class KeywordsDemo {
    private static final int MAX = 10;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** What keyword is used to prevent modification of a variable?
   **A:** `final` ‚Äì it makes a variable constant after initialization.
2. **Q:** Can you use `goto` in Java? Why or why not?
   **A:** No. It‚Äôs a reserved keyword but not implemented, so cannot be used.
3. **Q:** What does the `static` keyword do?
   **A:** Belongs to the class, not instances; accessible without creating an object.

---

## 2. Deep Dive: byte, short, int, long, float, double

### üîç Explanation

* **byte**: 8-bit signed integer, range ‚Äì128 to 127.
* **short**: 16-bit, ‚Äì32,768 to 32,767.
* **int**: 32-bit, ‚Äì2billion to 2billion, default for integers.
* **long**: 64-bit, very large range, suffix `L`.
* **float**: 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point, suffix `f`.
* **double**: 64-bit IEEE 754, default for decimal, more precision.

### ‚úÖ Summary

Each primitive numeric type balances memory and range. Use `int` and `double` by default; choose `byte`, `short`, `long`, or `float` only when specific memory or precision constraints apply. Misusing them can lead to overflow or precision issues.

```java
public class NumericDemo {
    byte b = 100;
    short s = 10_000;
    int i = 2_000_000_000;
    long l = 9_000_000_000L;
    float f = 3.14f;
    double d = 2.718281828459045;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new NumericDemo();
        System.out.printf("%d, %d, %d, %d, %.2f, %.15f%n", b, s, i, l, f, d);
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** Why suffix `L` for long, `f` for float?
   **A:** They differentiate types; without them, numbers default to `int` and `double`.
2. **Q:** When use `short` or `byte`?
   **A:** Rarely; mainly in memory-constrained situations like embedded systems.
3. **Q:** Why prefer `double` over `float`?
   **A:** More precision, and modern CPUs support it faster than `float`.

---

## 3. Syntax to Declare Primitives & Store Data

### üîç Explanation

* Syntax: `<type> <varName> = <value>;`
* You may omit initialization but must initialize before use.
* Declaration can be combined (e.g., `int x = 1, y = 2;`).
* Java compiler enforces type safety.
* Constants use `final` keyword (e.g., `final int DAYS = 7;`).

### ‚úÖ Summary

Declaring and assigning primitives is foundational. Java‚Äôs static typing forces correct matching between type and value. Constants provide immutability. These rules prevent many runtime errors.

```java
public class DeclarationDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 30, year = 2025;
        final double PI = 3.141592653589793;
        boolean isActive = true;
        System.out.println(age + ", " + year + ", " + PI + ", " + isActive);
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** Can you declare a variable without initializing?
   **A:** Yes, but must initialize before first use.
2. **Q:** Are variables auto-initialized?
   **A:** Local variables aren‚Äôt auto-initialized; fields are.
3. **Q:** What's the effect of `final` on a variable?
   **A:** Value can be assigned once, and cannot change after.

---

## 4. How to Name a Java Variable

### üîç Explanation

* Must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign, not a number.
* Case-sensitive.
* Use camelCase for variables (e.g., `myVariableName`).
* Choose meaningful names to improve readability.
* Avoid Java keywords and obscure abbreviations.

### ‚úÖ Summary

Good variable names improve code clarity and maintainability. Java enforces certain syntax rules, but your discipline in naming goes beyond compilation‚Äîit's about communication. Stick with established conventions like camelCase and avoid ambiguity.

```java
public class VariableNaming {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int customerCount = 120;
        double averageScore = 85.5;
        boolean isVerified = false;
        System.out.printf("%d customers, avg score %.1f, verified? %b%n",
             customerCount, averageScore, isVerified);
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** Why not use single-letter names like `x`, `y`?
   **A:** They‚Äôre unclear‚Äîuse descriptive names for readability.
2. **Q:** Is `$_value` valid?
   **A:** Technically yes, but not recommended per conventions.
3. **Q:** Can variable names start with a number?
   **A:** No, Java prohibits that syntax.

* **camelCase**: used for variables and methods (`totalAmount`).
* **PascalCase**: used for class names (`EmployeeRecord`).
* **UPPER\_SNAKE\_CASE**: used for constants (`MAX_SIZE`).
* **kebab-case**: not valid in Java (only used in file names or URLs).

### ‚úÖ Summary:

Following case styles in Java helps maintain consistency and readability. While Java is flexible in naming, adhering to standard conventions is critical for team collaboration, code reviews, and long-term maintenance.

```java
public class CaseStyleDemo {
    static final int MAX_USERS = 100;
    String userName = "Alice"; // camelCase
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CaseStyleDemo obj = new CaseStyleDemo();
        System.out.println(obj.userName + ", Max users: " + MAX_USERS);
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** What case style is used for constants in Java?
   **A:** `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_LIMIT`)
2. **Q:** What is the difference between camelCase and PascalCase?
   **A:** camelCase starts with a lowercase letter, PascalCase starts with uppercase.
3. **Q:** Why is kebab-case not valid in Java?
   **A:** Java doesn‚Äôt allow `-` in variable names‚Äîit‚Äôs seen as subtraction.

---

## **6. Deep Dive on boolean Primitive Data Type**

### üîç Explanation:

* Represents **true/false** logic in Java.
* Only two possible values: `true` and `false`.
* Default value is `false` (for instance variables).
* Commonly used in conditions and loops.
* Cannot be converted from/to numeric values (unlike C/C++).

### ‚úÖ Summary:

The `boolean` type is essential in Java for decision-making. It's strictly binary, enhancing code clarity and reducing bugs from unintended conversions. Ideal for flags, toggles, and conditional logic.

```java
public class BooleanDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean isActive = true;
        if (isActive) {
            System.out.println("User is active");
        }
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** Can a boolean hold 0 or 1 in Java?
   **A:** No, it can only hold `true` or `false`.
2. **Q:** What's the default value of boolean in a class?
   **A:** `false`
3. **Q:** Can boolean values be cast to int?
   **A:** No, Java does not allow implicit casting between boolean and numeric types.

---

## **7. Deep Dive on char Primitive Data Type**

### üîç Explanation:

* Represents a **single 16-bit Unicode character**.
* Declared using single quotes: `'A'`, `'9'`, `'@'`.
* Can store Unicode values (`\u0041` = 'A').
* Can be treated as an integer (ASCII/Unicode values).
* Used for characters, symbols, or control characters.

### ‚úÖ Summary:

`char` is versatile for text processing and encoding. Java uses Unicode, enabling global language support. It's useful in parsing, validation, and low-level encoding work, especially when reading raw input or working with ASCII.

```java
public class CharDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char ch = 'J';
        char unicodeCh = '\u004A'; // 'J'
        System.out.println(ch == unicodeCh); // true
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** How many bits is a `char` in Java?
   **A:** 16 bits (2 bytes).
2. **Q:** What encoding system does Java use for `char`?
   **A:** Unicode.
3. **Q:** Can we perform arithmetic on `char`?
   **A:** Yes, as it can be implicitly treated as an int.

---

## **8. Demo of Overflow and Underflow**

### üîç Explanation:

* Overflow: exceeding max value of type ‚Üí wraps to min value.
* Underflow: below min value ‚Üí wraps to max.
* Happens in **byte**, **short**, **int**, **long**.
* Java doesn't throw errors on overflow (unlike languages like Swift).
* Detected using conditionals or using `Math.addExact()` (throws exception).

### ‚úÖ Summary:

Understanding overflow/underflow is crucial in fixed-size data types. Java wraps values silently, which may lead to hidden bugs. Always test edge cases, especially in arithmetic or hardware-level programming.

```java
public class OverflowDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        byte b = 127;
        b++; // Overflow
        System.out.println("Overflowed byte: " + b); // Output: -128
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** What is integer overflow in Java?
   **A:** When a number exceeds the max value of its type and wraps around.
2. **Q:** Does Java throw error on overflow?
   **A:** No, it silently wraps values.

   **A:** Bitwise operations, flags, and embedded systems.

---

## **13. Type Casting in Java**

### üîç Explanation:

* Converts one data type to another.
* **Implicit casting**: automatic widening (e.g., int to long).
* **Explicit casting**: narrowing requires manual cast (e.g., double to int).
* Risk of data loss with narrowing types.
* Used to match method signatures or optimize memory.

### ‚úÖ Summary:

Type casting is essential when mixing data types. While implicit casting is safe and automatic, explicit casting must be done carefully to avoid data loss. Mastering casting helps you work with APIs, math, and system-level code.

```java
public class TypeCasting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 100;
        long b = a; // implicit
        double d = (double) b; // explicit
        System.out.println("Int: " + a + ", Long: " + b + ", Double: " + d);
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** What is implicit casting?
   **A:** Automatically converting smaller to larger type (e.g., int ‚Üí long).
2. **Q:** What‚Äôs the risk in explicit casting?
   **A:** Possible data loss or truncation.
3. **Q:** Is `float` to `int` implicit or explicit?
   **A:** Explicit ‚Äì must cast manually.

---

## **14. Demo of Implicit and Explicit Casting**

### üîç Explanation:

* Implicit: safe widening conversions (`byte ‚Üí int ‚Üí long ‚Üí float ‚Üí double`).
* Explicit: must cast manually for narrowing conversions.
* Truncation happens in float-to-int.
* Helps in array, arithmetic, and IO conversion logic.
* Casting doesn't convert between incompatible types (e.g., String ‚Üí int).

### ‚úÖ Summary:

Casting ensures type compatibility and control over data transformations. While implicit is safe, explicit should be used with caution. It's a common requirement when dealing with APIs, collections, or math.

```java
public class CastingDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        double y = x; // Implicit
        double z = 9.99;
        int truncated = (int) z; // Explicit
        System.out.println("Implicit: " + y + ", Explicit: " + truncated);
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** What happens when casting `9.8` to `int`?
   **A:** It becomes `9` (decimal truncated).
2. **Q:** Can you cast `boolean` to `int`?
   **A:** No ‚Äì incompatible types.
3. **Q:** Is casting reversible?
   **A:** Only if no data is lost (e.g., int ‚Üí double ‚Üí int might lose decimal).

---

## **15. Introduction to String in Java**

### üîç Explanation:

* `String` is a sequence of characters, stored as an object.
* Defined using double quotes: `"Hello"`.
* Immutable ‚Äì once created, it cannot be changed.
* Common methods: `.length()`, `.toUpperCase()`, `.substring()`.
* Part of `java.lang` ‚Äì no import needed.

### ‚úÖ Summary:

Strings are central to most Java applications, from input to output, logging to web development. Their immutability improves security and performance via string pooling, but developers must be aware of object vs reference semantics.

```java
public class StringIntro {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String msg = "Java Rocks!";
        System.out.println(msg.toUpperCase());
    }
}
```

## üîπ 5. **Constructor Chaining in Java**

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Use Case:

In an `Employee` class, chaining constructors for consistent setup logic.

### üîç Key Points:

* Constructor chaining calls one constructor from another using `this()`.
* Reduces code duplication.
* Ensures consistent initialization.
* Must be the first statement in the constructor.
* Useful in overloaded constructors.

### üìù Summary:

Constructor chaining improves code reuse and consistency by centralizing initialization logic. It simplifies object construction and reduces redundancy in overloaded constructors.

### üìå Code:

```java
public class Employee {
    String name;
    int age;

    public Employee() {
        this("John", 25);
    }

    public Employee(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Questions:

1. **Q:** What is constructor chaining?
   **A:** Calling one constructor from another in the same class using `this()`.

2. **Q:** Where must `this()` be placed?
   **A:** As the first statement in the constructor.

3. **Q:** Why use constructor chaining?
   **A:** To avoid code duplication and ensure consistent object initialization.

---

## üîπ 6. **Usage of Return Statement in Constructor**

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Use Case:

Trying to return a value from a constructor in a `Vehicle` class.

### üîç Key Points:

* Constructors **cannot** use `return` to return values.
* Using `return` with a value will cause a **compilation error**.
* A plain `return;` can be used to exit early (rarely needed).
* Object reference is implicitly returned after constructor completes.
* The purpose is initialization, not computation.

### üìù Summary:

The constructor is not meant to return values explicitly. Its sole purpose is to initialize the object. Using a `return` statement with a value leads to compilation errors.

### üìå Code:

```java
public class Vehicle {
    String type;

    public Vehicle(String t) {
        if(t == null) return;
        this.type = t;
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Questions:

1. **Q:** Can a constructor return a value?
   **A:** No, constructors do not return values.

2. **Q:** What happens if you use `return` with a value?
   **A:** Compilation error.

3. **Q:** Can you use a plain `return;` in a constructor?
   **A:** Yes, to exit early, but not common.

## üîπ 7. **Instance Initialization Block in Java - Part 1**

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Use Case:

Setting common initialization logic for all constructors in a `Device` class.

### üîç Key Points:

* Runs **before** constructor during object creation.
* Declared using `{}` directly in class body.
* Executes every time an object is created.
* Helps avoid code duplication across constructors.
* Often used for field initialization or logging.

### üìù Summary:

Instance initialization blocks are used to initialize common logic before any constructor executes. This helps streamline shared logic and reduce redundancy in object initialization.

### üìå Code:

```java
public class Device {
    String type;

    {
        System.out.println("Device created");
    }

    public Device() {}
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Questions:

1. **Q:** When does an instance initializer run?
   **A:** Before the constructor during object creation.

2. **Q:** Can it replace a constructor?
   **A:** No, but it complements it for shared logic.

3. **Q:** How many times is it executed?
   **A:** Once per object creation.

---

## üîπ 8. **Instance Initialization Block in Java - Part 2**

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Use Case:

Initializing non-static fields with custom logic in a `Laptop` class.

### üîç Key Points:

* Can contain complex logic (loops, conditions).
* Executes before any constructor.
* Useful when all constructors need common setup.
* Can initialize multiple fields at once.
* Combined with constructors for full setup.

### üìù Summary:

Advanced use of instance initializers allows developers to embed reusable logic that applies to all constructors, making code more concise and modular. It simplifies field preparation across multiple constructors.

### üìå Code:

```java
public
```


class Laptop {
String brand;
int price;

```
{
    brand = "DefaultBrand";
    price = 1000;
}

public Laptop() { }
```

}

````

### ‚ùì Interview Questions:
1. **Q:** Can initializers have logic like conditions or loops?  
   **A:** Yes.

2. **Q:** Are instance blocks executed for static methods?  
   **A:** No, only during object creation.

3. **Q:** Can you have multiple instance blocks?  
   **A:** Yes, and they execute in order of declaration.

## üîπ 9. **Introduction to Static Variables in Java**

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Use Case:
Tracking total number of `Product` objects created using a static counter.

### üîç Key Points:
- Shared across all instances of a class.
- Declared with the `static` keyword.
- Used for common properties like counters or constants.
- Memory-efficient since it is loaded once.
- Accessed via `ClassName.variableName`.

### üìù Summary:
Static variables are shared across all instances and used to maintain common state, like counters or configuration settings. They are loaded once with the class and accessed globally.

### üìå Code:
```java
public class Product {
    static int count = 0;

    public Product() {
        count++;
    }
}
````

### ‚ùì Interview Questions:

1. **Q:** What is a static variable?
   **A:** A variable shared across all instances of a class.

2. **Q:** When is a static variable initialized?
   **A:** When the class is loaded into memory.

3. **Q:** Can static variables be accessed without an object?
   **A:** Yes, using `ClassName.variable`.

---

## üîπ 10. **How to Define Constant Final Static Variables**

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Use Case:

Defining a tax rate constant in a `Billing` class.

### üîç Key Points:

* Use `static final` to create constants.
* Conventionally named in uppercase.
* Must be initialized during declaration or in a static block.
* Values cannot be changed once assigned.
* Shared across all objects.

### üìù Summary:

`static final` variables represent constants. They are initialized once, cannot be changed, and are shared across all instances, making them ideal for fixed configuration values.

### üìå Code:

```java
public class Billing {
    public static final double TAX_RATE = 0.18;
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Questions:

1. **Q:** What does `static final` mean?
   **A:** It's a constant value shared by all objects, set only once.

2. **Q:** Can a static final variable be reassigned?
   **A:** No, it is immutable.

3. **Q:** When should you use `static final`?
   **A:** For constants like `PI`, `TAX_RATE`.

---

## üîπ 11. **Differences Between Static & Instance Variables**

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Use Case:

Tracking `Employee` ID (instance) vs. total employees (static).

### üîç Key Points:

* Static variables are shared; instance variables are unique per object.
* Static belongs to the class; instance to the object.
* Static is initialized when the class loads.
* Instance is initialized during object creation.
* Access static via class; instance via object.

### üìù Summary:

Static variables represent global state, while instance variables maintain individual object data. Understanding the difference ensures proper memory usage and object-oriented design.

### üìå Code:

```java
public class Employee {
    static int totalEmployees = 0;
    int employeeId;

    public Employee(int id) {
        this.employeeId = id;
        totalEmployees++;
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Questions:

1. **Q:** What‚Äôs the main difference between static and instance variables?
   **A:** Static is shared; instance is object-specific.

2. **Q:** When is a static variable created?
   **A:** When the class is loaded.

3. **Q:** Can instance variables access static variables?
   **A:** Yes.

Got it! I'll break down each of your topics with:

* A real-time use-case coding example
* 5 bullet-point explanations
* A 5-line summary
* A short code snippet
* 3 interview-style Q\&A per topic

Let‚Äôs dive in:

---

## 1. **Introduction to static methods in Java**

**Use‚Äëcase example:** Utility method to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius without needing an object.

```java
public class TempConverter {
    public static double toCelsius(double f) {
        return (f - 32) * 5 / 9;
    }
}
```

* Belong to class, not instances.
* Can be called like `TempConverter.toCelsius(100)`.
* Cannot access non-static (instance) members.
* Good for stateless operations (e.g. math utilities).
* Loaded at class‚Äëloading time, memory‚Äëefficient.

**Summary:**
Static methods live on the class, usable without instantiation. Great for generic utilities. They can‚Äôt access instance data. Defined once, shared across all usage. Efficient for performance‚Äësensitive code.

**Code:**

```java
public class TempConverter {
    public static double toCelsius(double f) {
        return (f - 32) * 5 / 9;
    }
}
System.out.println(TempConverter.toCelsius(98.6));  // ~37¬∞C
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** Why use static over instance methods?
   **A:** For stateless behavior and to avoid creating unnecessary objects.
2. **Q:** Can a static method override instance methods?
   **A:** No. Static methods are not polymorphic‚Äîcan‚Äôt be overridden, only hidden.
3. **Q:** Can static methods access `this`?
   **A:** No. They don't belong to any instance.

---

## 2. **Static Initialization Block in Java class**

**Use‚Äëcase example:** Populate a static `Map` at class load time.

```java
public class Config {
    public static final Map<String, String> settings = new HashMap<>();
    static {
        settings.put("env", "prod");
        settings.put("version", "1.0");
    }
}
```

* Executes once when the class is first loaded.
* Perfect for complex static setup beyond simple field assignments.
* Can handle exceptions during class loading.
* Order of blocks and field declarations matters.
* Helps in centralizing initialization logic.

**Summary:**
Static blocks allow initialization of static data beyond literal defaults. They run once at class load, before any static methods or after static fields declared. Useful for complex setup or validation before usage.

**Code:**

```java
System.out.println(Config.settings.get("env"));  // prod
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** When do static blocks execute?
   **A:** When the JVM loads the class, before main or any static methods.
2. **Q:** Can static blocks throw checked exceptions?
   **A:** No‚Äîyou must catch them within the block.
3. **Q:** What if you have multiple static blocks?
   **A:** They're executed in the order they appear in the class.

---

## 3. **Debugging method invocations in IntelliJ**

**Use‚Äëcase example:** Stepping into a method to diagnose a bug.

* Set a breakpoint inside your target method.
* Use ‚ÄúDebug‚Äù mode to start.
* ‚ÄúStep Into (F7)‚Äù to follow call into deeper methods.
* ‚ÄúEvaluate Expression‚Äù to inspect variables on the fly.
* ‚ÄúFrames‚Äù panel shows call stack and allows jumping between method calls.

**Summary:**
IntelliJ's debugger lets you pause execution at breakpoints, step through lines, dive into method calls, and inspect runtime state. Use features like step into/out, variable watches, and call stacks to isolate issues quickly. It‚Äôs essential for building robust code.

```java
// put breakpoint here:
public void transfer(int amount) {
    balance -= amount;
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** What is ‚ÄúStep Over‚Äù vs ‚ÄúStep Into‚Äù?
   **A:** Step Over moves to next line, skipping into calls; Step Into dives into method calls.
2. **Q:** How can you change a variable‚Äôs value mid-debug?
   **A:** Use ‚ÄúEvaluate Expression‚Äù or ‚ÄúVariables‚Äù pane to edit the value.
3. **Q:** What‚Äôs conditional breakpoints?
   **A:** Breakpoints that only pause execution if a given condition is true.

---

## 4. **Where does Java store classes, objects, variables, methods**

**Use‚Äëcase example:** Understanding memory layout for performance tuning.

* **Classes & metadata** ‚Üí in the *Metaspace* (JDK 8+).
* **Static variables & methods** ‚Üí in the *Method Area / Metaspace*.
* **Objects & instance fields** ‚Üí on the *Heap*.
* **Local variables & operand stacks** ‚Üí on the *Stack*.
* **Constant pools & interned strings** ‚Üí Method Area.

**Summary:**
Java divides memory into stack and heap, plus metaspace. Classes, statics, and runtime structures sit in metaspace. Each thread gets its own stack for call frames. Objects reside on the shared heap, managed by GC. Knowing this helps optimize memory and troubleshoot errors.

```java
int local = 5;  // stack
MyClass obj = new MyClass();  // heap + reference on stack
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** Why are local variables on stack?
   **A:** Stack allocation is quick and scope-limited with automatic cleanup.
2. **Q:** What happens if heap is full?
   **A:** JVM triggers Garbage Collection; if still full ‚Üí `OutOfMemoryError`.
3. **Q:** What changed after JDK 8 regarding method area?
   **A:** Permanent Generation replaced by native Metaspace, dynamically sized.

---

## 5. **Deep dive on Heap memory and stack memory**

**Use‚Äëcase example:** Optimize recursive algorithm to avoid stack overflow.

* **Stack memory**: Stores method frames, locals, call return info. LIFO structure.
* **Heap memory**: Stores all objects/arrays, shared among threads.
* Stack is size-limited; deep recursion can cause `StackOverflowError`.
* Heap is garbage‚Äëcollected‚Äîsize adjustable via `-Xmx`.
* Heap fragmentation and GC pauses are performance considerations.

**Summary:**
Stack and heap serve different memory needs in Java. Stack is thread‚Äëlocal, fast, and auto-cleans. Heap holds dynamic data and is GC-managed. Stack overflows come from deep recursion or huge frames; heap issues include `OutOfMemoryError` and GC tuning. Understanding both ensures stable and efficient apps.

```java
void recurse(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return;
    recurse(n - 1);
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** Which is faster: stack or heap?
   **A:** Stack‚Äîautomatic allocation/deallocation without GC overhead.
2. **Q:** How to avoid `StackOverflowError`?
   **A:** Use iterative logic or increase stack size with `-Xss`.
3. **Q:** How to tune heap size for a large web server?
   **A:** Adjust `-Xms` and `-Xmx`; monitor with tools like VisualVM.

---

## 6. **Introduction to null in Java**

**Use‚Äëcase example:** Validate nullable parameters.

```java
public void setName(String name) {
    if (name == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("name cannot be null");
    this.name = name;
}
```

* `null` means "no reference"‚Äînot object, not type.
* Dereferencing causes `NullPointerException`.
* Use null checks or `Optional` to avoid runtime errors.
* Lombok/annotation tools (`@NonNull`) enforce at compile/runtime.
* Guard clauses (`Objects.requireNonNull`) are common.

**Summary:**
`null` is a universal sentinel for missing references. It can lead to runtime crashes, so good practices include explicit null checks, using `Optional`, and leveraging static analysis. Understanding `null` is crucial for robust null-aware code.

```java
String s = null;
if (s != null) System.out.println(s.length());
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** What causes `NullPointerException`?
   **A:** Accessing a method or field on a `null` reference.
2. **Q:** Difference between `== null` and `Objects.isNull()`?
   **A:** Functionally the same; latter improves readability in streams.
3. **Q:** Why use `Optional<String>`?
   **A:** Makes potential emptiness explicit; encourages safe handling.

---

## 7. **Object Destruction and Garbage collection in Java**

**Use‚Äëcase example:** Finalizing unclosed I/O resources (discouraged).

* No explicit destructor; GC reclaims inaccessible objects.
* `finalize()` deprecated; unreliable.
* Use `try-with-resources` or explicit cleanup methods.
* GC runs automatically; tunable via algorithms (G1, Parallel, ZGC).
* `System.gc()` is advisory only.

**Summary:**
Java relies on Garbage Collection to free unused objects. Avoid `finalize()`‚Äîprefer explicit resource management. GC tuning can optimize performance. Understanding reachability and reference types (weak, soft, strong) helps manage memory.

```java
try (FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream(path)) {
    // use in
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** How do you force garbage collection?
   **A:** Call `System.gc()`‚Äîbut it‚Äôs merely a hint.
2. **Q:** Why avoid `finalize()`?
   **A:** It's unpredictable, may resurrect objects, causes performance issues.
3. **Q:** What GC algorithm suits low pause times?
   **A:** ZGC or Shenandoah are designed for low latency.

---

## 8. **Class vs Object vs Instance vs Reference**

**Use‚Äëcase example:** Instantiating and using a `Car`.

* **Class**: blueprint `class Car { ‚Ä¶ }`.
* **Object**: concrete entity, e.g. `new Car()`.
* **Instance**: synonym for object created from class.
* **Reference**: variable pointing to object, e.g. `Car c`.
* Multiple references can point to same instance.

**Summary:**
A class is the template; an instance/object is its realization in memory. References are variables that point to objects. Understanding this helps clarify identity, memory behavior, and aliasing in Java.

```java
Car a = new Car("Red");
Car b = a;  // both refer to same instance
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** Can two references point to different objects?
   **A:** Yes‚Äîthey‚Äôre independent unless explicitly assigned.
2. **Q:** What‚Äôs the difference between identity and equality?
   **A:** Identity (`==`) checks if references are same object; `equals()` checks logical equivalence.
3. **Q:** Can an object exist without a reference?
   **A:** Yes‚Äîuntil GC removes it when unreachable.

---

## 9. **What is encapsulation in Java**

**Use‚Äëcase example:** Protecting password field in `User`.

```java
public class User {
    private String password;
    public void setPassword(String pw) {
        if (pw == null || pw.length() < 8)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("weak pw");
        this.password = pw;
    }
    public boolean check(String pw) {
        return this.password.equals(pw);
    }
}
```

* Hide internals by using `private` fields.
* Provide public getters/setters with checks.
* Prevent direct manipulation of fields.
* Supports immutability and object integrity.
* Makes API easier to maintain and modify internally.

**Summary:**
Encapsulation bundles data and logic while hiding implementation details. It ensures control over state via access modifiers and methods. This fosters code safety, maintainability, and abstraction‚Äîkey tenets of OOP.

```java
User u = new User();
u.setPassword("secure123");
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** Why use private fields?
   **A:** To prevent unauthorized access and maintain control.
2. **Q:** How does encapsulation help in software evolution?
   **A:** Internal changes don‚Äôt affect external users if interfaces remain stable.
3. **Q:** Is a getter always safe?
   **A:** Not necessarily‚Äîif you return mutable internal data, you may expose internal state.

### 1. Introduction to String Pool in Java

**Use-case:** Deduplicating log messages to save memory.

* Java interns literal strings in a shared pool.
* Two identical literals reference the same `String` object.
* Heap-allocated `new String(...)` not pooled unless `.intern()` is called.
* Saves memory, avoids duplicate copies.
* Faster equality checks (`==`) for pooled strings.

**Summary:** Java maintains a string pool that deduplicates literal strings. Literals with identical content point to the same memory, improving performance. Strings created via `new` aren't pooled unless `.intern()` is used. This helps reduce memory footprint for repetitive strings, like log tags.

```java
String a = "INFO";
String b = "INFO";
String c = new String("INFO");
System.out.println(a == b);             // true (same pool object)
System.out.println(a == c);             // false (different object)
String d = c.intern();
System.out.println(a == d);             // true (c interned refers pool)
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* Why use string pool?
   *A:* To save memory and speed up equality with `==` on string literals.
2. *Q:* What does `intern()` do?
   *A:* Adds the string to the pool or returns existing, enabling pooling.
3. *Q:* Effects of `new String("foo")`?
   *A:* Creates separate heap objects, bypassing the pool until interned.

---

### 2. The `intern()` method in String

**Use-case:** Cache frequently used user roles as strings.

* `intern()` returns a canonical representation from the pool.
* Helps enforce reference-based equality.
* Useful for memory savings in high-volume strings.
* May cost performance when pooling very many strings.
* Ideal when you know a small set of repeating strings.

**Summary:** `.intern()` lets you leverage the string pool for runtime-generated strings. It ensures only one instance exists for a given content, improving `==` comparisons and memory efficiency. Use it when reusing many string instances‚Äîjust know it can have runtime cost.

```java
Map<String,String> cache = new HashMap<>();
String role = fetchRole();              // e.g., "ADMIN"
role = role.intern();
cache.put(role, value);
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* Difference between `intern()` and `==`?
   *A:* `intern()` ensures pool uniqueness; `==` checks reference equality.
2. *Q:* When should you avoid using `intern()`?
   *A:* If many unique strings, performance/memory overhead outweighs benefits.
3. *Q:* What‚Äôs returned if pool entry exists?
   *A:* The existing pooled string reference.

---

### 3. The `concat()` method in String

**Use-case:** Building a file path by concatenating directory names.

* `concat()` appends to original string, returning new instance.
* Equivalent to using `+` but clearer in intent.
* More efficient than repeated `+` in loops (though StringBuilder often better).
* Handles null argument with `NullPointerException`.
* Ideal for small, controlled concatenations.

**Summary:** `String.concat()` appends two strings into a new string object. It‚Äôs clear and concise, equivalent to `+`, but still immutable. For many concatenations, prefer `StringBuilder`. Watch out‚Äîpassing `null` crashes.

```java
String base = "/user/data";
String file = base.concat("/file.txt");
System.out.println(file); // "/user/data/file.txt"
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* Does `concat()` modify the original string?
   *A:* No. It returns a new `String` object.
2. *Q:* What happens if you pass `null` to `concat()`?
   *A:* Throws `NullPointerException`.
3. *Q:* Which is faster: `concat()` or `+` operator?
   *A:* Similar; both create new strings, but `+` may use `StringBuilder` under the hood.

---

### 4. Escape sequences & Unicode in String

**Use-case:** Logging user input containing quotes.

* `\n`, `\t`, `\"`, `\\` etc. for control characters.
* Unicode escapes like `\u00A9` for ¬©.
* Especially useful in source code for non-ASCII.
* Helps control visual formatting in output.
* Must escape `"` inside a string literal.

**Summary:** Escape sequences allow embedding special characters (like newline, tabs, quotes, backslashes) into strings. Unicode escapes let you include arbitrary code points directly. This is essential when working with special characters or non-ASCII symbols in source code.

```java
String msg = "He said: \"Hello!\n\"\u2602\"";
System.out.println(msg);
// output:
// He said: "Hello!
// "‚òÇ"
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* How do you embed a double quote in a Java string literal?
   *A:* Use `\"`.
2. *Q:* How to include non-ASCII chars?
   *A:* Use Unicode escapes like `\uXXXX`.
3. *Q:* Can you have `\n` for line breaks in code?
   *A:* Yes ‚Äì it embeds a newline character.

---

### 5. Finding the length of a String

**Use-case:** Validating password minimum length.

* `.length()` returns the number of UTF-16 code units.
* Does not count Unicode surrogate pairs as one code point.
* Useful for input validation.
* Simple, constant-time method.
* For Unicode code points, use `codePointCount()`.

**Summary:** `.length()` returns the number of UTF‚Äë16 units, which covers most characters but counts surrogate pairs separately. It's used for simple length checks, but consider `codePointCount()` when dealing with emoji or rare Unicode characters.

```java
String pwd = "pass„ÉØord";
if (pwd.length() < 8) {
    System.out.println("Password too short.");
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* What does `length()` return?
   *A:* The number of UTF‚Äë16 code units.
2. *Q:* How count actual graphemes or emoji?
   *A:* Use `codePointCount(0, str.length())`.
3. *Q:* `.length()` is O(1)?
   *A:* Yes, it retrieves a stored field.

---

### 6. Comparing Strings in Java

**Use-case:** Checking user login credentials.

* Use `.equals()` for content comparison.
* `==` compares object references.
* `.equalsIgnoreCase()` for case‚Äëinsensitive match.
* `.compareTo()` for lexicographical ordering.
* Null-safe compare: use `Objects.equals(a,b)`.

**Summary:** Use `equals()` to compare content, `==` only for reference check. For ignoring case, use `equalsIgnoreCase()`. To sort strings, use `compareTo()`. Always avoid `==` for normal comparisons to prevent logic bugs.

```java
String input = getUserInput();
if ("admin".equalsIgnoreCase(input)) {
    System.out.println("Welcome, Admin!");
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* Why not use `==`?
   *A:* It tests reference, not content equality.
2. *Q:* What does `compareTo()` return?
   *A:* Negative if less, zero if same, positive if greater.
3. *Q:* Null-safe equals best practice?
   *A:* Use `Objects.equals(a,b)` or `"literal".equals(var)`.

---

### 7. Fetching a character at an index

**Use-case:** Validating first character of a code.

* `.charAt(index)` returns a `char`.
* Zero-based indexing; throws `IndexOutOfBoundsException` on invalid index.
* Use to inspect specific positions.
* Check input like postal codes, product codes, etc.
* Works across all BMP characters; surrogate pairs need care.

**Summary:** Use `charAt()` to fetch a character at a specific position. It's useful for format or prefix validation. Remember zero-based indexing and exceptions on invalid access. For full Unicode characters, more care is needed.

```java
String code = "A2025X";
if (code.charAt(0) == 'A') {
    System.out.println("Valid code prefix");
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* What's returned by `charAt()` for index out of range?
   *A:* Throws `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
2. *Q:* Is indexing zero-based?
   *A:* Yes.
3. *Q:* How to get Unicode code points?
   *A:* Use `codePointAt()`.

---

### 8. Checking if a String is empty

**Use-case:** Form field validation for non-empty input.

* `.isEmpty()` checks for `length() == 0`.
* Does **not** check for only whitespace.
* More intuitive than `.length() == 0`.
* Avoids NullPointerException by pre-checking null.
* Combine with `.trim()` for blank-strings detection.

**Summary:** `.isEmpty()` quickly tells you if a string has zero length. It's simpler and clearer than using `length()`. For blank or whitespace-only checks, combine with `.trim()` or use `.isBlank()` in Java 11+.

```java
String field = "";
if (field == null || field.isEmpty()) {
    System.out.println("Field must be filled");
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* Difference `isEmpty()` vs `isBlank()`?
   *A:* `isBlank()` also checks whitespace-only.
2. *Q:* What if `.isEmpty()` on a null?
   *A:* Throws `NullPointerException`.
3. *Q:* Preferred null-safe empty check?
   *A:* `field == null || field.isEmpty()`.

---

### 9. Changing the case in String

**Use-case:** Normalizing user emails for lookup.

* `.toLowerCase()` / `.toUpperCase()` changes case per locale.
* Default uses default locale; overloadable with `Locale`.
* Returns new string, original unchanged.
* Useful for case-insensitive comparisons.
* Watch locale-specific accents (e.g., Turkish ‚Äòi‚Äô).

**Summary:** Use `.toLowerCase()` or `.toUpperCase()` to normalize string case‚Äîespecially for user input. For consistent behavior, always specify a locale. Note linguistic nuances like Turkish dotless ‚Äòi‚Äô.

```java
String email = getEmailInput();
String normalized = email.trim().toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT);
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* Why pass `Locale`?
   *A:* Avoid locale-specific quirks; use ROOT for consistency.
2. *Q:* Do these modify original?
   *A:* No‚Äîthey return new strings.
3. *Q:* Behavior with accents?
   *A:* Locale-sensitive; best practice to specify locale explicitly.

---

### 10. Converting values to String

**Use-case:** Logging metrics.

* `String.valueOf(...)` handles primitives and null safely.
* `Integer.toString()` or `Double.toString()` for primitives.
* `String.format()` for formatted numbers.
* `+ ""` also works but less explicit.
* `Objects.toString(obj, default)` for null-safe conversions.

**Summary:** Use `String.valueOf(...)` for null-safe primitive conversion. `toString()` methods exist on wrappers. For formatted output, use `String.format()`. Avoid relying on `+ ""` in non-trivial cases.

```java
int count = 42;
double price = 19.99;
String log = "Processed " + String.valueOf(count) + " items at $"
             + Double.toString(price);
System.out.println(log);
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* `String.valueOf(null)` returns?
   *A:* `"null"` (string literal).
2. *Q:* `int + ""` vs `String.valueOf(int)`?
   *A:* Both convert, but `+ ""` uses concatenation; `valueOf` is clearer.
3. *Q:* Formatting decimals cleanly?
   *A:* Use `String.format("%.2f", value)`.

Sure! I'll provide detailed explanations, real-time use case coding examples, summaries, and interview questions with answers for each topic in **Section 7: Operators in Java** as you requested. Given the extensive list, I'll start with the first few topics here and continue the rest in follow-ups if you'd like. Here we go:

---

### 1. Introduction to Operators & Operands in Java

**Explanation:**

* **Operators** are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on variables and values.
* **Operands** are the variables or values on which operators act.
* Java supports various types of operators: arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, etc.
* Operators can be unary (one operand), binary (two operands), or ternary (three operands).
* Understanding operators is fundamental for writing effective Java programs that perform calculations, comparisons, and logic.

**Summary:**
Operators are the building blocks for expressions in Java. Every operator works on operands to produce a result. Whether it's simple addition or complex logical operations, knowing how to use operators allows programmers to manipulate data effectively. Java has a rich set of operators, making it versatile for different programming needs.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class OperatorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;        // Operand
        int b = 5;         // Operand
        int sum = a + b;   // '+' is operator, a and b are operands
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
}
```

---

### 2. Assignment Operator in Java

**Explanation:**

* The assignment operator `=` assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
* It can also be combined with other operators for shorthand assignments like `+=`, `-=`, etc.
* It is a binary operator because it works with two operands (variable and value).
* Assignment is essential for storing values in variables.
* Supports chaining assignments (e.g., `a = b = 5;` assigns 5 to both `a` and `b`).

**Summary:**
The assignment operator is one of the most commonly used operators in Java. It initializes and updates variable values. Using combined assignment operators can make code concise and readable, especially when performing operations and assignments in one step.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class AssignmentOperator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;        // Simple assignment
        x += 5;            // Equivalent to x = x + 5
        System.out.println("x = " + x);  // Output: 15
    }
}
```

---

### 3. Introduction to Arithmetic Operators in Java

**Explanation:**

* Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations on numeric operands.
* Operators include `+` (add), `-` (subtract), `*` (multiply), `/` (divide), and `%` (modulus).
* They are binary operators and return numeric results.
* Arithmetic operators respect precedence and associativity rules.
* They can be used with both integer and floating-point data types.

**Summary:**
Arithmetic operators allow Java to perform basic calculations necessary for almost any program. They enable addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder calculations. Their behavior depends on operand types, and they obey standard mathematical precedence.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class ArithmeticOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 12, b = 5;
        System.out.println("a + b = " + (a + b));
        System.out.println("a - b = " + (a - b));
        System.out.println("a * b = " + (a * b));
        System.out.println("a / b = " + (a / b));      // Integer division
        System.out.println("a % b = " + (a % b));      // Modulus
    }
}
```

---

### 4. Addition Operator in Java

**Explanation:**

* The `+` operator adds two numeric values.
* When used with strings, it concatenates (joins) them.
* It works with various numeric types: int, float, double, etc.
* Can cause type promotion if operands are of different types.
* Overloaded for string concatenation, making it versatile.

**Summary:**
The addition operator is versatile in Java, used for arithmetic addition and string concatenation. It allows developers to perform numerical summations or combine strings seamlessly. This dual role often makes it one of the most frequently used operators.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class AdditionOperator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 20;
        int num2 = 30;

### 5. String Concatenation Operator

**Explanation:**

* The `+` operator concatenates two or more strings.
* It converts non-string operands to strings if one operand is a string.
* Useful for building messages, logs, or combined string output.
* Supports chaining for concatenating multiple strings.
* Can cause performance issues in loops; `StringBuilder` is preferred there.

**Summary:**
String concatenation with `+` provides a simple and readable way to combine strings in Java. It's widely used for output formatting and dynamic string generation. For heavy string concatenation inside loops, alternate classes are more efficient.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class StringConcat {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String greeting = "Hello";
        String name = "Alice";
        String message = greeting + ", " + name + "!";
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}
```

### 1. Greater than, Greater than or equal, Less than, Less than or equal operators

**Explanation:**

* These are **relational operators** used to compare two values.
* They return a boolean (`true` or `false`) based on the comparison.
* `>` checks if left operand is greater than right operand.
* `>=` checks if left operand is greater than or equal to right operand.
* `<` and `<=` work similarly for less than and less than or equal to comparisons.
* Commonly used in conditional statements, loops, and filtering data.

**Summary:**
Relational operators are essential in decision-making in Java. They allow developers to compare numeric values and make logical decisions, such as controlling loops or validating input. The result is always boolean, simplifying control flow in applications.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class RelationalOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 25;
        System.out.println("Is age greater than 18? " + (age > 18));          // true
        System.out.println("Is age greater or equal to 25? " + (age >= 25));  // true
        System.out.println("Is age less than 30? " + (age < 30));             // true
        System.out.println("Is age less or equal to 20? " + (age <= 20));     // false
    }
}
```

### 2. Introduction to Logical Operators in Java

**Explanation:**

* Logical operators combine multiple boolean expressions.
* Include `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), and `!` (logical NOT).
* They evaluate boolean values and return a boolean result.
* Used extensively in conditional logic to form complex conditions.
* Important for flow control in if-else, loops, and boolean flag checks.

**Summary:**
Logical operators enable complex condition evaluation by combining simpler boolean expressions. They are fundamental in controlling program flow and decision-making, allowing multiple conditions to be tested in a concise and readable way.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class LogicalOperatorsIntro {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean isAdult = true;
        boolean hasID = false;
        System.out.println("Can enter club: " + (isAdult && hasID)); // false
    }
}
```

---

### 3. Logical NOT operator in Java

**Explanation:**

* The logical NOT operator `!` negates a boolean value.
* If operand is `true`, `!` makes it `false`, and vice versa.
* Unary operator working on a single boolean operand.
* Useful to reverse conditions in if-statements or loops.
* Helps simplify boolean expressions by toggling logic.

**Summary:**
The logical NOT operator is crucial when you need to invert a boolean condition. It's a simple but powerful way to alter program logic, often improving readability by clearly expressing "not" conditions.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class LogicalNotOperator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean isRaining = false;
        if (!isRaining) {
            System.out.println("Go outside and enjoy the sun!");
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Logical Short-Circuit AND (`&&`), Logical AND (`&`) operators in Java

**Explanation:**

* `&&` is the short-circuit AND operator: it stops evaluating if the first operand is `false`.
* `&` is the logical AND operator that always evaluates both operands.
* Both return `true` only if both operands are `true`.
* `&&` improves performance by avoiding unnecessary evaluations.
* `&` can be used in boolean and bitwise contexts, but mostly boolean here.

**Summary:**
Short-circuit AND (`&&`) is preferred for boolean logic because it improves efficiency by skipping evaluation when possible. The regular AND (`&`) always evaluates both operands, which may be needed in some cases but is less efficient.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class LogicalAndOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5;
        int y = 10;
        if (x > 0 && y / x > 1) {   // short-circuit avoids division by zero
            System.out.println("Condition met!");
        }
        if (x > 0 & y / x > 1) {    // both sides always evaluated
            System.out.println("Condition met again!");
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 5. Logical Short-Circuit OR (`||`), Logical OR (`|`) operators in Java

**Explanation:**

* `||` is the short-circuit OR operator: stops evaluating if first operand is `true`.
* `|` is the logical OR operator, always evaluates both operands.
* Both return `true` if any operand is `true`.
* `||` optimizes performance by preventing unnecessary evaluation.
* Used in conditions where multiple alternatives can satisfy a requirement.

**Summary:**
Logical OR operators allow checking multiple conditions where any can be true. The short-circuit version (`||`) enhances efficiency by stopping evaluation once the result is known. The full OR (`|`) always evaluates both sides, which may be necessary in some cases.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class LogicalOrOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean isWeekend = true;
        boolean isHoliday = false;
        if (isWeekend || isHoliday) {  // short-circuit stops after true
            System.out.println("You can relax today!");
        }
        if (isWeekend | isHoliday) {   // both evaluated
            System.out.println("You can relax today too!");
        }
    }
}
```

### 6. Logical XOR operator in Java

**Explanation:**

* The XOR operator `^` returns `true` if operands differ.
* Returns `false` if both operands are the same (`true`/`true` or `false`/`false`).
* Used for toggling flags or detecting difference between two booleans.
* Can be used in boolean logic and bitwise operations.
* Useful in situations requiring exclusive conditions.

**Summary:**
Logical XOR is valuable when you need to know if exactly one of two conditions is true. It's often used in toggling states or exclusive conditions where both cannot be true or false simultaneously.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class LogicalXOROperator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean a = true;
        boolean b = false;
        System.out.println("a ^ b = " + (a ^ b));  // true
        System.out.println("a ^ a = " + (a ^ a));  // false
    }
}
```

### 7. Compound Logical Assignment Operators in Java

**Explanation:**

* Compound logical assignment operators combine logical operations and assignment.
* Examples: `&=`, `|=`, `^=` which apply logical operation and assign the result.
* Useful in updating boolean flags concisely.
* Shortcuts for `x = x && y` as `x &= y` (similarly for OR and XOR).
* Makes code cleaner when updating boolean state based on another condition.

**Summary:**
Compound logical assignment operators simplify code by combining logic and assignment into a single step. They are particularly useful for flag management, enabling concise and readable updates of boolean variables.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class CompoundLogicalAssignment {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean isActive = true;
        boolean isUserVerified = false;
        
        isActive &= isUserVerified;  // Equivalent to isActive = isActive && isUserVerified
        System.out.println("Is active and verified? " + isActive);  // false
    }
}
```

* Operate on bits rather than logical boolean values.
* Critical for system programming, manipulating flags, and graphics programming.

**Summary:**
Bitwise operators give Java programs the ability to manipulate data at the bit level. They are powerful tools for performance-critical applications, enabling direct control over memory and hardware. While less common in day-to-day programming, they are essential in specialized domains.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class BitwiseOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5;      // 0101 in binary
        int b = 3;      // 0011 in binary
        System.out.println("a & b = " + (a & b));  // 1 (0001)
        System.out.println("a | b = " + (a | b));  // 7 (0111)
        System.out.println("a ^ b = " + (a ^ b));  // 6 (0110)
        System.out.println("~a = " + (~a));        // -6 (two's complement)
    }
}
```

---

### 9. Bitwise NOT operator or 1‚Äôs complement in Java

**Explanation:**

* Bitwise NOT operator `~` flips every bit of an integer operand.
* Converts 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s (1's complement).
* Result is the two's complement negative plus one (due to integer representation).
* Used for negation and bit masking in low-level code.
* Changes positive numbers to negative and vice versa in binary representation.

**Summary:**
The bitwise NOT operator inverses bits of an integer, effectively performing a one‚Äôs complement operation. It‚Äôs mainly used in bit manipulation tasks, such as toggling bits or creating masks.

}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** How does the `else if` differ from `if`?
   **A:** `else if` only runs if previous `if` or `else if` conditions are false.

2. **Q:** Can you have multiple `else` blocks?
   **A:** No, only one `else` block is allowed at the end.

3. **Q:** What happens if no `if` condition is true and no `else` exists?
   **A:** No code inside the `if` block executes; program continues after.

---

## 3. Nested if- else if - else statements

**Use case:**
Checking multiple criteria in an application, e.g., checking user login status and then their role to show different menus.

**Bullet points:**

* You can place an `if` or `if-else` inside another `if` or `else` block.
* Helps handle complex conditions with multiple layers.
* Inner `if` executes only if outer `if` is true.
* Can be used to refine decisions step-by-step.
* Careful indentation improves readability.

**Summary:**
Nested `if-else` statements allow multi-level decision-making by embedding conditional checks inside one another. This is useful for scenarios like role-based access control or multi-step validation. However, deeply nested blocks should be avoided or refactored for clarity.

```java
public class NestedIfExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean loggedIn = true;
        String role = "admin";

        if (loggedIn) {
            if (role.equals("admin")) {
                System.out.println("Show admin dashboard");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Show user dashboard");
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("Please log in");
        }
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** When to use nested if statements?
   **A:** When decisions depend on multiple levels of conditions.

2. **Q:** Can nested if statements affect performance?
   **A:** Slightly, but usually negligible; readability is a bigger concern.

3. **Q:** How to improve readability of nested ifs?
   **A:** Use helper methods or switch to switch-case if applicable.

---

## 4. Ternary operator in place of if-else statement

**Use case:**
Quickly assign values based on conditions, like setting a discount if a user is premium.

**Bullet points:**

* Shorthand for simple `if-else` statements.
* Syntax: `condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;`
* Returns a value, so can be used inline.
* Improves code conciseness.
* Not recommended for complex conditions.

**Summary:**
The ternary operator provides a concise way to write simple conditional assignments, reducing verbosity compared to `if-else`. It‚Äôs useful in return statements or variable initialization, but for complex logic, traditional `if-else` is clearer.

```java
public class TernaryExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 20;
        String eligibility = (age >= 18) ? "Eligible to vote" : "Not eligible";
        System.out.println(eligibility);
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** What is the syntax of the ternary operator?
   **A:** `condition ? expression1 : expression2`

2. **Q:** Can ternary operator replace all if-else?
   **A:** No, only simple if-else where both branches return values.

3. **Q:** Is ternary operator good for readability?
   **A:** Yes, for simple cases; no for complex nested conditions.

---

## 5. Deep dive on switch case statement

**Use case:**
Menu-driven applications where user inputs are mapped to actions.

**Bullet points:**

* Switch evaluates a variable/expression and jumps to matching case.
* Cases must be constant expressions.
* Includes `default` case if no match.
* Break statement exits the switch block.
* Useful alternative to multiple if-else for equality checks.

**Summary:**
The `switch` statement simplifies decision-making when checking one variable against many constant values. It improves readability over long if-else chains and provides a clear structure for menu-driven or multi-option handling. Proper use of `break` avoids fall-through bugs.

```java
public class SwitchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int day = 3;
        switch(day) {
            case 1: System.out.println("Monday"); break;
            case 2: System.out.println("Tuesday"); break;
            case 3: System.out.println("Wednesday"); break;
            default: System.out.println("Invalid day"); break;
        }
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** What types can be used in switch cases?
   **A:** `byte`, `short`, `char`, `int`, `String` (Java 7+), enum types.

2. **Q:** What happens if `break` is omitted?
   **A:** Fall-through occurs, executing next case(s) until break.

3. **Q:** Can switch cases evaluate ranges?
   **A:** No, only exact matches; use if-else for ranges.

## 6. \[JAVA 14] Deep dive on switch expression

**Use case:**
Assigning a value using switch directly in variable initialization or returning from a method.

**Bullet points:**

* Switch expression introduced in Java 14.
* Can return a value directly.
* Supports arrow `->` syntax.
* No need for `break` statement.
* Can have multiple labels per case.

**Summary:**
Java 14‚Äôs switch expressions enhance switch by making it a value-returning expression with concise syntax and safer control flow, eliminating `break` statements. This feature improves clarity and reduces boilerplate, making switch a more powerful and functional construct.

```java
public class SwitchExpressionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int day = 3;
        String dayName = switch(day) {
            case 1 -> "Monday";
            case 2 -> "Tuesday";
            case 3 -> "Wednesday";
            default -> "Invalid day";
        };
        System.out.println(dayName);
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** What‚Äôs new in Java 14 switch expressions?
   **A:** Switch can now return values and uses arrow syntax without break.

2. **Q:** Can multiple cases be combined in Java 14 switch expression?
   **A:** Yes, separated by commas.

3. **Q:** What happens if no case matches in switch expression?
   **A:** `default` case runs; if missing, compiler error if no match possible.

---

## 7. Deep dive on while statement

**Use case:**
Reading data from a file or stream until end-of-file is reached.

**Bullet points:**

* Executes block repeatedly while condition is true.
* Condition evaluated before each iteration.
* May run zero times if condition false initially.
* Used for indefinite loops when exit condition is known.
* Careful to update condition to avoid infinite loop.

**Summary:**
The `while` loop in Java is suited for scenarios where the number of iterations is unknown upfront but depends on a condition being true. It evaluates the condition before each loop, making it ideal for reading data or waiting for events until a stop condition occurs.

```java
public class WhileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int count = 1;
        while (count <= 5) {
            System.out.println("Count: " + count);
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** When is a while loop useful?
   **A:** When iteration count is not known beforehand and depends on a condition.

2. **Q:** Can a while loop run zero times?
   **A:** Yes, if the condition is false at the start.

3. **Q:** How to avoid infinite loops with while?
   **A:** Ensure loop condition eventually becomes false inside loop.

---

## 8. Deep dive on do while statement

**Use case:**
Menu display that runs at least once and then asks if user wants to continue.

**Bullet points:**

* Executes loop body at least once.
* Condition checked after loop body.
* Useful for input validation loops.
* Guarantees minimum one execution.
* Syntax: `do { ... } while(condition);`

**Summary:**
The `do-while` loop ensures the code block runs at least once before checking the condition. This makes it perfect for scenarios like user input prompts where the operation must be performed before deciding to repeat.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class DoWhileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int number;
        do {
            System.out.print("Enter a positive number: ");
            number = sc.nextInt();
        } while (number <= 0);
        System.out.println("You entered: " + number);
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** What is the main difference between while and do-while?
   **A:** `do-while` runs body once before checking condition; `while` checks before running.

2. **Q:** When should you use do-while?
   **A:** When you want loop body to run at least once.

3. **Q:** Can a do-while loop run forever?
   **A:** Yes, if condition never becomes false.

---

## 9. Deep dive on for loop

**Use case:**
Iterating over arrays or collections when iteration count is known.

**Bullet points:**

* Loop control with initialization, condition, increment/decrement.
* Runs while condition is true.
* Compact syntax, useful for counted loops.
* Common in array and collection traversal.
* Easy to maintain and read.

**Summary:**
The `for` loop is a concise looping structure commonly used when the number of iterations is predetermined, such as traversing arrays or performing repeated tasks a fixed number of times. It combines loop control statements in one line for clarity.

```java
public class ForLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Iteration " + i);
        }
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** What are the components of a for loop?
   **A:** Initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

2. **Q:** Can the for loop run zero times?
   **A:** Yes, if condition is false initially.

**Bullet points:**

* Skips the current iteration and proceeds to next.
* Useful to avoid nested ifs.
* Can be used in all loops.
* Helps in filtering unwanted cases.
* Keeps loop concise and readable.

**Summary:**
The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the loop body for the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. It is helpful when certain conditions should bypass specific loop executions.

```java
public class ContinueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) continue;  // Skip even numbers
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** What does continue do in a loop?

* Package name uses dot notation (e.g., `com.myapp.utils`).
* Classes declared inside that source file belong to the package.
* Compile source files respecting package directory structure.

**Summary:**
Creating a package involves declaring the package name in the Java file and placing the source files in matching directories. This creates a logical grouping of classes. Proper directory structure and package declaration are essential for the Java compiler and JVM to recognize package membership.

```java
package com.myapp.utils;

public class StringUtil {
    public static String reverse(String str) {
        return new StringBuilder(str).reverse().toString();
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** How do you create a package in Java?
   **A:** By declaring `package <package_name>;` at the top of the source file.

2. **Q:** Why must the directory structure match the package name?
   **A:** To let the compiler and JVM find and load classes correctly.

3. **Q:** Can a source file belong to multiple packages?
   **A:** No, each source file belongs to only one package.

---

## 3. Rules & standards to name a package

**Use case:**
Naming your company‚Äôs packages following conventions for consistency (e.g., `com.company.project.module`).

   **A:** No, it‚Äôs automatically available.

---

## 6. The static import statements

**Use case:**
Using `Math` class methods directly without prefixing with `Math.` (e.g., `sqrt` instead of `Math.sqrt`).

**Bullet points:**

* Introduced in Java 5 to import static members.
* Use `import static` keyword followed by static member or wildcard.
* Allows calling static methods or variables without class name prefix.
* Improves code readability when static members are used frequently.
* Overuse can reduce clarity; use judiciously.

**Summary:**
Static import lets you use static members of classes directly without the class name, simplifying code when such members are used repeatedly. It is useful in math-heavy or constant-rich code but should be used with caution to keep code understandable.

```java
import static java.lang.Math.*;

public class StaticImportExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double val = sqrt(25);  // no Math. prefix
        System.out.println("Square root: " + val);
    }
}
```

## 7. Important points about packages & imports

**Use case:**
Understanding best practices to avoid confusion when working on multi-module projects.

**Bullet points:**

* Packages prevent class name conflicts by namespacing.
* Import statements do not copy code; just tell compiler where to find classes.
* Classes in the same package can access package-private members.
* Explicit import improves clarity, wildcard imports are discouraged in large projects.
* Fully qualified class names can be used without imports.

**Summary:**
Packages and imports work together to organize Java code and manage dependencies. Proper use of imports keeps code clean and maintainable, while packages ensure modularity and access control.

```java
// Using fully qualified name without import
public class FullyQualifiedExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        com.myapp.utils.StringUtil util = new com.myapp.utils.StringUtil();
        System.out.println(util.reverse("Java"));
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** Do imports copy code into your program?
   **A:** No, they just let compiler know where to find classes.

2. **Q:** What is package-private access?
   **A:** Members accessible within same package without modifier.

3. **Q:** Can you use fully qualified class names without imports?
   **A:** Yes, but it makes code verbose.

---

## 8. Introduction to access modifiers

**Use case:**
Controlling visibility of classes and members in an API or library.

**Bullet points:**

* Four access levels: `public`, `protected`, default (package-private), `private`.
* `public`: accessible everywhere.
* `private`: accessible only within the same class.
* `protected`: accessible within package and subclasses.
* Default access means accessible only within the same package.

**Summary:**
Access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of classes and members, allowing encapsulation and hiding implementation details. They form a key part of designing secure and maintainable Java code.

```java
public class AccessExample {
    public int publicVar;
    private int privateVar;
    protected int protectedVar;
    int defaultVar;  // package-private
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** What does `private` mean?
   **A:** Accessible only inside the class itself.

2. **Q:** Who can access `protected` members?
   **A:** Same package classes and subclasses.

Creating a public API class and a helper class restricted to the package.

**Bullet points:**

* Classes can be `public` or default (no modifier).
* Public classes are accessible anywhere.
* Default classes are accessible only within the same package.
* Only one public class per `.java` file is allowed.
* Class accessibility controls API exposure.

**Summary:**
Class-level access modifiers define if a class can be accessed globally or only within its package. Public classes form the API surface, while default-access classes act as internal helpers, ensuring encapsulation at the package level.

```java
// In file com/example/PublicClass.java
package com.example;

public class PublicClass {
    public void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello from PublicClass");
    }
}

// In file com/example/HelperClass.java
package com.example;

class HelperClass {
    void assist() {
        System.out.println("Assisting...");
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** Can a class be declared `private`?
   **A:** No, top-level classes cannot be private.

2. **Q:** How many public classes per file?
   **A:** Only one public class per `.java` file.

3. **Q:** What does default access on class mean?
   **A:** Class accessible only within its package.

## 10. Demo of access modifiers for methods, fields in classes

**Use case:**
Encapsulating data by making fields private and providing public getter/setter methods.

**Bullet points:**

* Methods and fields can be declared with any access modifier.
* `private` fields hide data from outside.
* Public methods expose controlled access.
* Protected methods available to subclasses.
* Package-private members accessible within same package.

**Summary:**
Access modifiers for class members allow encapsulation by restricting or permitting access to fields and methods. This enforces good design practices like hiding implementation details


and exposing only necessary operations.

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    protected int age;
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** Why make fields private?
   **A:** To protect data and control access.

2. **Q:** Who can access protected methods?
   **A:** Subclasses and classes in the same package.

3. **Q:** What is encapsulation?
   **A:** Hiding data and exposing behavior through methods.

### 1. Introduction to Inheritance in Java

**Explanation & Use Case:**

Inheritance allows a new class (subclass) to acquire the properties and methods of an existing class (superclass), promoting code reusability and hierarchical classification.

**Use Case:**
Imagine a Vehicle superclass with general properties like speed, and subclasses like Car and Bike inherit these properties but add their own specific features.

* Enables code reuse without rewriting common code.
* Supports hierarchical class organization.
* Helps in method overriding and polymorphism.
* Subclasses can add or modify behavior of superclass.
* Provides a clear model of ‚Äúis-a‚Äù relationships (Car **is-a** Vehicle).

**Summary:**
Inheritance is a fundamental OOP concept in Java that allows subclasses to inherit fields and methods from a superclass, promoting reuse and organization of code. It supports extending functionality and creating hierarchical relationships between classes. This mechanism also enables polymorphism and dynamic method dispatch, essential for flexible and maintainable code.

```java
class Vehicle {
    int speed = 50;
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle speed: " + speed);
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    int wheels = 4;
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Car wheels: " + wheels);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.display();  // inherited method
        car.show();     // subclass method
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What is inheritance in Java?*
   **Answer:** Inheritance is a mechanism where one class acquires properties and methods of another class, promoting code reuse.

2. *What are the benefits of inheritance?*
   **Answer:** Code reusability, method overriding, polymorphism support, and hierarchical classification.

3. *Can a Java class inherit from multiple classes?*
   **Answer:** No, Java supports single inheritance only but multiple interfaces can be implemented.

---

### 2. Object class is the default Superclass

**Explanation & Use Case:**

In Java, every class implicitly extends `java.lang.Object` if no other superclass is specified, meaning all classes inherit basic methods like `toString()`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, etc.

**Use Case:**
If you create a class Person, it automatically inherits methods from Object, so you can override `toString()` for meaningful output.

* Every class inherits from Object by default.
* Object provides core methods like `toString()`, `equals()`.
* You can override these methods in your class.
* `Object` methods enable fundamental behavior in collections, comparisons.
* It is the root of the class hierarchy in Java.

**Summary:**
The `Object` class is the root superclass for all Java classes. All classes, even if they don‚Äôt explicitly extend another class, inherit from Object. This provides a common interface for basic methods useful across all objects. Developers often override Object methods to provide custom behavior.

```java
class Person {
    String name;
    Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Person: " + name;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p = new Person("Alice");
        System.out.println(p.toString()); // Output: Person: Alice
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What is the default superclass of all Java classes?*
   **Answer:** The `java.lang.Object` class.

2. *Name some methods inherited from Object class.*
   **Answer:** `toString()`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `clone()`, `getClass()`.

3. *Why do we override `toString()` method?*
   **Answer:** To provide meaningful string representation of objects.

---

### 3. is-a & has-a relationships in Java

**Explanation & Use Case:**

* **is-a** represents inheritance relationship (e.g., Dog **is-a** Animal).
* **has-a** represents composition/aggregation (e.g., Car **has-a** Engine).

**Use Case:**
A class Car inherits Vehicle (is-a) but has an Engine object (has-a).

* **is-a** represents inheritance.
* **has-a** represents composition.
* Helps design relationships in class models.
* is-a enables polymorphism.
* has-a promotes modular design and reuse.

**Summary:**
In Java, `is-a` relationship means inheritance (subclass extends superclass), while `has-a` indicates composition where one class contains references to another. Correct use of both relationships helps build well-structured and maintainable code with clear object relationships.

```java
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

class Vehicle {
    int speed = 50;
}

class Car extends Vehicle {  // is-a relationship
    Engine engine = new Engine();  // has-a relationship
    
    void startCar() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car started at speed " + speed);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.startCar();
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *Explain the difference between is-a and has-a relationships.*
   **Answer:** is-a is inheritance, has-a is composition.

2. *Give an example of has-a relationship in Java.*
   **Answer:** A Car has an Engine.

3. *Can a class have multiple is-a relationships?*
   **Answer:** No, Java supports single inheritance, so one is-a (single parent) relationship per class.

---

### 4. What a subclass inherits from its superclass

**Explanation & Use Case:**

A subclass inherits all accessible members (fields and methods) of its superclass except constructors and private members.

**Use Case:**
A subclass can access public/protected fields and methods and can override superclass methods.

* Inherits public and protected members.
* Private members are not inherited but accessible via getter/setter.
* Constructors are not inherited.
* Static members are shared, but not inherited like instance members.
* Subclass can override inherited methods.

**Summary:**
A subclass inherits all non-private members (fields, methods) from its superclass. It can use and override these inherited members, providing extended or modified functionality. Private members remain hidden and must be accessed through getters/setters if needed.

```java
class Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
    
    private void secret() {
        System.out.println("Secret method");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound();  // overridden method
        // dog.secret(); // Compile error: secret is private
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *Can a subclass inherit private members of its superclass?*
   **Answer:** No, private members are not inherited.

2. *Are constructors inherited by subclasses?*
   **Answer:** No, constructors are not inherited.

3. *Can static members be overridden?*
   **Answer:** No, static members are hidden, not overridden.

---

### 5. Introduction to upcasting in Java

**Explanation & Use Case:**

Upcasting is casting a subclass reference to a superclass reference, often done implicitly. It helps achieve polymorphism by treating subclass objects as superclass types.

**Use Case:**
Storing objects of different subclasses in a superclass type reference or collection.

* Happens implicitly in Java.
* Enables polymorphic behavior.
* Only superclass methods accessible (unless overridden).
* Useful for generalization and collections.
* Upcasting never throws ClassCastException.

**Summary:**
Upcasting is converting a subclass reference to a superclass reference type. It‚Äôs a safe cast that enables polymorphism by allowing a single reference type to refer to objects of multiple subclasses. This promotes flexible and generic code.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
    void fetch() {
        System.out.println("Dog fetches");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Dog();  // upcasting
        animal.sound();  // Dog's overridden method called
        // animal.fetch(); // Compile error: fetch() not in Animal
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What is upcasting in Java?*
   **Answer:** Assigning a subclass object reference to a superclass type variable.

2. *Is upcasting safe or unsafe?*
   **Answer:** Upcasting is always safe.

3. *Can you call subclass-specific methods on an upcasted object directly?*
   **Answer:** No, only superclass methods are accessible.

---

### 6. Introduction to downcasting & its demo

**Explanation & Use Case:**

Downcasting is casting a superclass reference back to a subclass reference. It requires explicit cast and can throw `ClassCastException` if done incorrectly.

**Use Case:**
When you want to access subclass-specific methods on an upcasted object.

* Requires explicit cast.
* Can throw ClassCastException if invalid.
* Used to access subclass-specific behavior.
* Must check type before downcasting.
* Works only if the object is actually an instance of the subclass.

**Summary:**
Downcasting converts a superclass reference back into a subclass reference. It allows access to subclass-specific methods but must be done carefully with type checking to avoid runtime exceptions.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
    void fetch() {
        System.out.println("Dog fetches");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Dog();  // upcasting
        if (animal instanceof Dog) {
            Dog dog = (Dog) animal;  // downcasting
            dog.fetch();
        }
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What is downcasting?*
   **Answer:** Casting a superclass reference to a subclass reference.

2. *What exception can downcasting throw?*
   **Answer:** `ClassCastException`.

3. *How do you safely perform downcasting?*
   **Answer:** Using `instanceof` to check before casting.

---

### 7. instanceof Operator

**Explanation & Use Case:**

`instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a specified class or interface.

**Use Case:**
Before downcasting, you check type to avoid exceptions.

* Returns true if object is instance of class/interface.
* Helps in safe downcasting.
* Useful in polymorphic collections.
* Works with inheritance and interfaces.
* Can prevent runtime errors.

**Summary:**
The `instanceof` operator tests whether an object is of a given type at runtime. It‚Äôs often used before downcasting to ensure safety, avoiding `ClassCastException`. It also helps in type checking in polymorphic scenarios.

```java
Animal animal = new Dog();
System.out.println(animal instanceof Dog);     // true
System.out.println(animal instanceof Animal);  // true
System.out.println(animal instanceof Object);  // true
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What does `instanceof` do?*
   **Answer:** Checks if an object is an instance of a given type.

2. *When is `instanceof` useful?*
   **Answer:** Before downcasting to ensure safe casting.

3. *Does `instanceof` work with interfaces?*
   **Answer:** Yes, it works with interfaces and classes.

### 8. Static Binding and Dynamic Binding in Java

**Explanation & Use Case:**

* Static binding: method call resolved at compile-time (static, private, final methods).
* Dynamic binding: method call resolved at runtime (overridden methods).

**Use Case:**
Overriding instance methods are dynamically bound allowing runtime polymorphism.

* Static binding for private/static/final methods.
* Dynamic binding for overridden instance methods.
* Dynamic binding enables polymorphism.
* Static binding improves performance.
* Java uses dynamic binding for method overriding.

**Summary:**
Static binding occurs at compile time for private, static, and final methods, while dynamic binding occurs at runtime for overridden methods, enabling polymorphism. Dynamic binding lets Java decide which method implementation to call based on the actual object.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Animal static method");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Dog static method");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();
        a.sound();           // dynamic binding -> Dog's method
        a.staticMethod();    // static binding -> Animal's static method
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What is static binding?*
   **Answer:** Method calls resolved at compile time, for static/private/final methods.

2. *What is dynamic binding?*
   **Answer:** Method calls resolved at runtime for overridden methods.

3. *Which binding supports polymorphism?*
   **Answer:** Dynamic binding.

---

### 9. What is Polymorphism in Java

**Explanation & Use Case:**

Polymorphism means ‚Äúmany forms‚Äù ‚Äì the ability of a variable, function, or object to take multiple forms. Achieved through method overriding and upcasting.

**Use Case:**
A single method call can invoke different subclass methods depending on the object type.

* Supports method overriding.
* Enables code flexibility and extensibility.
* Allows generic programming.
* Improves maintainability.
* Implemented through inheritance and interfaces.

**Summary:**
Polymorphism in Java allows a single interface to represent different underlying forms (objects). It enables dynamic method dispatch, where the appropriate subclass method is called during runtime, providing flexibility and extensibility in code design.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a1 = new Dog();
        Animal a2 = new Cat();
        a1.sound();  // Dog barks
        a2.sound();  // Cat meows
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *Define polymorphism.*
   **Answer:** Ability of an object to take many forms, especially through method overriding.

2. *How is polymorphism achieved in Java?*
   **Answer:** Through method overriding and upcasting.

3. *What is dynamic method dispatch?*
   **Answer:** Process of calling overridden methods at runtime based on object type.

---

### 10. Method Overriding

**Explanation & Use Case:**

Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method declared in its superclass.

**Use Case:**
Different animals make different sounds, so subclasses override `sound()` method.

* Signature must be same.
* Allows runtime polymorphism.
* Access modifier can‚Äôt be more restrictive.
* Overridden method can call superclass method using `super`.
* Supports dynamic binding.

**Summary:**
Method overriding enables a subclass to provide specific behavior by redefining a method from its superclass. It‚Äôs key to runtime polymorphism and allows different implementations of the same method signature based on the object‚Äôs actual type.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Dog();
        animal.sound();  // Dog barks
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What is method overriding?*
   **Answer:** Redefining a superclass method in subclass with the same signature.

2. *Can we override static methods?*
   **Answer:** No, static methods cannot be overridden.

3. *What is the access modifier rule for overriding?*
   **Answer:** Subclass method cannot have more restrictive access.

---

### 11. super keyword to invoke superclass methods from subclass

**Explanation & Use Case:**

The `super` keyword in Java is used to access superclass methods or constructors from a subclass.

**Use Case:**
Calling a superclass constructor or method when overridden in subclass.

* Used to call superclass constructor.
* Used to call superclass methods hidden by overriding.
* Helps avoid code duplication.
* Allows subclass to extend behavior.
* Must be the first statement in constructor when calling super().

**Summary:**
The `super` keyword allows a subclass to access members (methods/constructors) of its superclass, especially useful when overriding methods or extending constructor behavior. It enables reusing and extending functionality safely.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        super.sound();  // calling superclass method
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound();
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What does the `super` keyword do?*
   **Answer:** Accesses superclass members or constructors.

2. *Can `super()` be used anywhere in a constructor?*
   **Answer:** No, it must be the first statement.

3. *Why use `super.method()`?*
   **Answer:** To call the overridden method in superclass.

### 1. Method Overloading

**Explanation & Use Case:**

Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists within the same class.

**Use Case:**
A Calculator class might have multiple `add` methods for adding integers, doubles, or three numbers.

* Same method name with different parameters.
* Supports compile-time polymorphism.
* Improves code readability.
* Helps in handling different input types.
* Methods differ by parameter type, number, or order.

**Summary:**
Method overloading allows multiple methods in a class to have the same name but different parameter signatures. It is a form of compile-time polymorphism that improves readability and usability by handling different data types or numbers of parameters elegantly.

```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 10));          // 15
        System.out.println(calc.add(2.5, 3.5));       // 6.0
        System.out.println(calc.add(1, 2, 3));        // 6
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What is method overloading?*
   **Answer:** Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class.

2. *Is return type considered in method overloading?*
   **Answer:** No, only parameter list matters for overloading.

3. *What type of polymorphism does overloading support?*
   **Answer:** Compile-time polymorphism.

---

### 2. Method overriding vs Method overloading

**Explanation & Use Case:**

* **Overriding:** Subclass provides a new implementation for a superclass method with the same signature.
* **Overloading:** Same method name but different parameters within the same class.

**Use Case:**
Overriding is used for runtime polymorphism (e.g., Animal‚Äôs sound overridden by Dog). Overloading allows methods like `print(String)` and `print(int)` in the same class.

* Overriding occurs in inheritance; overloading in the same class.
* Overriding has same method signature; overloading has different parameters.
* Overriding is runtime polymorphism; overloading is compile-time.
* Overriding requires inheritance; overloading does not.
* Overriding changes behavior; overloading adds flexibility.

**Summary:**
Method overriding changes the behavior of an inherited method in a subclass for runtime polymorphism, while method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class for compile-time polymorphism. Both enhance flexibility but in different contexts.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
    
    void print(String s) {
        System.out.println("String: " + s);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }

    // Overloading print method
    void print(int i) {
        System.out.println("Int: " + i);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound();          // overriding
        dog.print("Hello");   // inherited method
        dog.print(100);       // overloaded method
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What is the main difference between method overloading and overriding?*
   **Answer:** Overloading changes method parameters; overriding changes method implementation.

2. *Which supports runtime polymorphism?*
   **Answer:** Method overriding.

3. *Can method overloading occur without inheritance?*
   **Answer:** Yes, it occurs within the same class.

---

### 3. Method hiding in Java Inheritance

**Explanation & Use Case:**

Method hiding occurs when a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as a static method in superclass.

**Use Case:**
Static utility methods in subclass can hide static methods in superclass.

* Applies only to static methods.
* Hiding method called based on reference type.
* Does not support polymorphism.
* Different from overriding (which is for instance methods).
* Can cause confusion if not understood properly.

**Summary:**
Method hiding happens when a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as a superclass static method. The method called depends on the reference type, not the object type, so it doesn‚Äôt support polymorphism like overriding.

```java
class Parent {
    static void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent static display");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    static void display() {
        System.out.println("Child static display");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent p = new Child();
        p.display();   // Parent static display (method hiding)
        Child c = new Child();
        c.display();   // Child static display
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What is method hiding?*
   **Answer:** When a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as a superclass static method.

2. *Does method hiding support polymorphism?*
   **Answer:** No, it is resolved at compile-time based on reference type.

3. *How is method hiding different from overriding?*
   **Answer:** Hiding applies to static methods; overriding applies to instance methods.

---

### 4. Field hiding in Java Inheritance

**Explanation & Use Case:**

Field hiding occurs when a subclass declares a field with the same name as a field in superclass.

**Use Case:**
If both superclass and subclass have `int count`, referencing `count` depends on reference type.

* Applies to fields, not methods.
* Hides superclass field, but superclass field still exists.
* Field accessed based on reference type.
* Does not support polymorphism.
* Can cause confusion, so should be avoided.

**Summary:**
Field hiding happens when a subclass declares a field with the same name as one in its superclass. The field accessed depends on the reference type, and unlike methods, fields do not exhibit polymorphism in Java.

```java
class Parent {
    int x = 10;
}

class Child extends Parent {
    int x = 20;
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent p = new Child();
        System.out.println(p.x);  // 10 (parent‚Äôs x)
        Child c = new Child();
        System.out.println(c.x);  // 20 (child‚Äôs x)
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What is field hiding?*
   **Answer:** When subclass declares a field with the same name as a superclass field.

2. *Is field hiding polymorphic?*
   **Answer:** No, field hiding is resolved based on reference type.

3. *Should field hiding be avoided? Why?*
   **Answer:** Yes, because it leads to confusion and bugs.

### 5. The story of constructors & Inheritance together

**Explanation & Use Case:**

Constructors are not inherited but superclass constructors are called before subclass constructors.

**Use Case:**
Calling superclass constructor to initialize inherited fields.

* Subclass constructor calls superclass constructor implicitly or explicitly.
* If no explicit call, default superclass constructor is called.
* Helps initialize superclass part of subclass object.
* Constructor chaining follows inheritance hierarchy.
* `super()` must be first statement in subclass constructor if used.

**Summary:**
Constructors are not inherited but are chained during object creation. A subclass constructor calls its superclass constructor (explicitly with `super()` or implicitly) to ensure proper initialization of inherited members before initializing its own.

```java
class Parent {
    Parent() {
        System.out.println("Parent constructor");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    Child() {
        super();  // optional here, called implicitly if omitted
        System.out.println("Child constructor");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child c = new Child();
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *Are constructors inherited in Java?*
   **Answer:** No, constructors are not inherited.

2. *How does a subclass constructor call superclass constructor?*
   **Answer:** Using `super()` explicitly or implicitly.

3. *Where must `super()` appear in subclass constructor?*
   **Answer:** As the first statement.

---

### 6. this and super keywords in Java

**Explanation & Use Case:**

* `this` refers to the current class instance.
* `super` refers to the immediate superclass.

**Use Case:**
`this` differentiates fields from parameters; `super` accesses superclass members.

* `this()` calls current class constructor.
* `super()` calls superclass constructor.
* `this.field` differentiates local and instance variables.
* `super.method()` calls superclass method.
* Helps in constructor chaining and method overriding.

**Summary:**
`this` and `super` keywords help manage references within inheritance. `this` refers to the current object, while `super` accesses superclass constructors and methods. They facilitate clear and controlled use of members and constructors in class hierarchies.

```java
class Parent {
    int x = 10;
    Parent() {
        System.out.println("Parent constructor");
    }
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Parent x: " + x);
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    int x = 20;
    Child() {
        super();
        System.out.println("Child constructor");
    }
    void show() {
        super.show();
        System.out.println("Child x: " + this.x);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child c = new Child();
        c.show();
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What does `this` keyword represent?*
   **Answer:** The current object instance.

2. *What is `super` used for?*
   **Answer:** Access superclass methods and constructors.

3. *Can `this()` and `super()` both be used in the same constructor?*
   **Answer:** No, only one can be the first statement.

---

### 7. Types of Inheritance in Java

**Explanation & Use Case:**

Java supports:

* Single Inheritance
* Multilevel Inheritance
* Hierarchical Inheritance
* Hybrid Inheritance (via interfaces, as multiple inheritance of classes is not allowed)

**Use Case:**
Modeling real-world relationships; e.g., Employee (single), Manager extends Employee (multilevel).

* Single: one subclass, one superclass.
* Multilevel: chain of inheritance.
* Hierarchical: multiple subclasses from one superclass.
* Multiple inheritance via interfaces only.
* Helps structure large projects logically.

**Summary:**
Java supports various inheritance types to model relationships: single (one subclass one superclass), multilevel (inheritance chain), and hierarchical (one superclass multiple subclasses). Multiple inheritance of classes is not allowed but achieved via interfaces.

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal eats");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {   // Single Inheritance
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Puppy extends Dog {    // Multilevel Inheritance
    void weep() {
        System.out.println("Puppy weeps");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Puppy p = new Puppy();
        p.eat();
        p.bark();
        p.weep();
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What types of inheritance are supported in Java?*
   **Answer:** Single, multilevel, hierarchical, and multiple inheritance via interfaces.

2. *Does Java support multiple inheritance of classes?*
   **Answer:** No, only multiple inheritance via interfaces.

3. *Give an example of multilevel inheritance.*
   **Answer:** Class C extends B, which extends A.

---

### 8. abstract methods and classes

**Explanation & Use Case:**

Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and can contain abstract methods (without body) which subclasses must implement.

**Use Case:**
Base class Vehicle declares abstract method `move()`, subclasses implement specific movement.

* Abstract methods have no implementation.
* Abstract class can have non-abstract methods.
* Forces subclasses to provide method implementation.
* Used for incomplete base classes.
* Supports polymorphism with abstraction.

**Summary:**
Abstract classes provide a template with some common functionality and some abstract methods for subclasses to implement. They enforce contracts for subclasses and enable abstraction, which helps in designing flexible and extensible systems.

```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void move();

    void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle started");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void move() {
        System.out.println("Car moves on road");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle v = new Car();
        v.start();
        v.move();
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What is an abstract class?*
   **Answer:** A class that cannot be instantiated and can have abstract methods.

2. *Can abstract class have concrete methods?*
   **Answer:** Yes, it can have implemented methods.

3. *Why use abstract methods?*
   **Answer:** To enforce subclasses to provide method implementations.

---

### 9. final keyword in Java

**Explanation & Use Case:**

`final` keyword can be used with variables, methods, and classes.

**Use Case:**
Constants declared as `final`, methods that shouldn‚Äôt be overridden, classes that shouldn‚Äôt be subclassed.

* final variable: constant value.
* final method: cannot be overridden.
* final class: cannot be subclassed.
* Improves security and design integrity.
* Helps prevent unintended modification or inheritance.

**Summary:**
The `final` keyword restricts modification or inheritance. Final variables become constants, final methods cannot be overridden, and final classes cannot be extended. It helps in writing secure, predictable, and maintainable code.

```java
final class Constants {
    static final double PI = 3.14159;
}

class Parent {
    final void display() {
        System.out.println("Final method in parent");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // void display() {} // Compile error: cannot override final method
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Constants.PI);
        Parent p = new Parent();
        p.display();
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What does the final keyword do when applied to a variable?*
   **Answer:** Makes the variable a constant.

2. *Can a final method be overridden?*
   **Answer:** No, final methods cannot be overridden.

3. *Can a final class be subclassed?*
   **Answer:** No, final classes cannot be extended.

### 10. \[JAVA 17]


sealed classes & interfaces

**Explanation & Use Case:**

Sealed classes restrict which other classes can extend or implement them, improving control over inheritance.

**Use Case:**
Defining a restricted hierarchy of shapes where only `Circle` and `Square` can extend `Shape`.

* Declared with `sealed` keyword.
* Specify permitted subclasses using `permits` clause.
* Permitted subclasses can be `final`, `sealed`, or `non-sealed`.
* Improves maintainability and security.
* Introduced in Java 17 for better inheritance control.

**Summary:**
Sealed classes and interfaces let developers restrict which classes can extend or implement them, enabling controlled class hierarchies and better maintainability. Only permitted subclasses can inherit, reducing accidental misuse.

```java
sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Square {
    double area();
}

final class Circle implements Shape {
    double radius;
    Circle(double r) { radius = r; }
    public double area() { return Math.PI * radius * radius; }
}

final class Square implements Shape {
    double side;
    Square(double s) { side = s; }
    public double area() { return side * side; }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape c = new Circle(5);
        Shape s = new Square(4);
        System.out.println(c.area());
        System.out.println(s.area());
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What is a sealed class?*
   **Answer:** A class that restricts which other classes can extend it.

2. *How do you specify permitted subclasses?*
   **Answer:** Using the `permits` clause.

3. *Can a permitted subclass be non-sealed?*
   **Answer:** Yes, it can be `final`, `sealed`, or `non-sealed`.

                                                              Section 11: Interfaces in Java

Sure! Let's go step by step through **Section 11: Interfaces in Java** with detailed explanations, real-time use cases, example codes, summaries, and interview questions for each topic.

---

### 1. Introduction to Interfaces

**Explanation:**

* Interfaces define a contract that implementing classes must follow.
* They declare method signatures without implementations (until Java 8).
* Used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
* Promote loose coupling by programming to an interface, not an implementation.
* Useful in defining APIs and plug-in architectures.

**Use Case:**
Suppose you are building a payment gateway system. You define an interface `Payment` which has methods like `pay()`. Different payment methods (CreditCard, PayPal) implement this interface.

**Summary:**
Interfaces provide a blueprint for classes to follow. They enable abstraction and multiple inheritance by specifying method contracts without dictating implementation. Interfaces are essential in designing flexible and maintainable systems by separating what to do from how to do it.

```java
interface Payment {
    void pay(double amount);
}

class CreditCard implements Payment {
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card.");
    }
}

class PayPal implements Payment {
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using PayPal.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Payment payment = new CreditCard();
        payment.pay(1000);
        
        payment = new PayPal();
        payment.pay(1500);
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** What is an interface in Java?
   **A:** An interface is a reference type in Java that defines abstract methods which implementing classes must provide. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance.

2. **Q:** Can you instantiate an interface?
   **A:** No, interfaces cannot be instantiated directly because they may have abstract methods without implementation.

3. **Q:** How do interfaces differ from abstract classes?
   **A:** Interfaces can only declare method signatures (until Java 7), no method bodies (except default/static methods in Java 8+), while abstract classes can have method implementations and instance variables.

---

### 2. Constant Field Declarations in Interface

**Explanation:**

* All fields declared in interfaces are implicitly `public static final`.
* These constants can be accessed directly via the interface name.
* They provide shared constants across implementing classes.
* No need to specify `public static final` explicitly.
* Useful for defining configuration or default values.

**Use Case:**
Defining error codes or application-wide constants for consistent reference.

**Summary:**
Fields in an interface are implicitly constant, static, and public, enabling the sharing of constant values across different classes without duplication. This promotes consistency and clean code, especially for fixed configuration values.

```java
interface AppConstants {
    int ERROR_CODE = 1001; // implicitly public static final
    String APP_NAME = "MyApp";
}

class Application implements AppConstants {
    void printConstants() {
        System.out.println("App: " + APP_NAME + ", Error Code: " + ERROR_CODE);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Application app = new Application();
        app.printConstants();
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** Are fields in interfaces mutable?
   **A:** No, all interface fields are implicitly `public static final`, so they are constants and cannot be changed.

2. **Q:** Why are constants declared in interfaces useful?
   **A:** They provide a common place to define fixed values that can be shared and reused by all implementing classes.

3. **Q:** Do you need to specify `public static final` when declaring fields in interfaces?
   **A:** No, these modifiers are implicit for all interface fields.

---

### 3. \[JAVA 8] How to build default methods in interfaces

**Explanation:**

* Java 8 introduced `default` methods in interfaces with a method body.
* Allows interfaces to provide method implementations.
* Helps in extending interfaces without breaking existing implementations.
* Classes can override default methods if needed.
* Promotes backward compatibility and evolution of APIs.

**Use Case:**
Adding a new method to an existing interface without breaking all implementing classes.

**Summary:**
Default methods allow interfaces to have concrete method implementations, enabling interface evolution while maintaining backward compatibility. This reduces the need for modifying all implementing classes when new functionality is added.

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void drive();
    
    default void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is starting");
    }
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle car = new Car();
        car.start();  // calls default method
        car.drive();
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** What is a default method in an interface?
   **A:** A default method is a method with a body defined in an interface using the `default` keyword, introduced in Java 8.

2. **Q:** Can a class override a default method?
   **A:** Yes, a class implementing the interface can override the default method to provide its own implementation.

3. **Q:** Why were default methods introduced in Java 8?
   **A:** To allow interfaces to evolve by adding new methods without breaking existing implementations.

---

### 4. \[JAVA 8] How to build static methods in interfaces

**Explanation:**

* Interfaces can have static methods with a method body.
* Static methods belong to the interface, not the implementing classes.
* Can be used for utility or helper methods related to the interface.
* Cannot be overridden by implementing classes.
* Accessed using the interface name directly.

**Use Case:**
Utility method like validation or factory method related to the interface.

**Summary:**
Static methods in interfaces provide utility functions related to the interface‚Äôs domain without requiring implementation in classes. They promote cleaner and more modular code and are accessed via the interface itself.

```java
interface MathOperations {
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = MathOperations.add(10, 20);
        System.out.println("Sum: " + result);
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** Can static methods in interfaces be overridden?
   **A:** No, static methods belong to the interface and cannot be overridden by implementing classes.

2. **Q:** How do you call a static method defined in an interface?
   **A:** By using the interface name, e.g., `InterfaceName.methodName()`.

3. **Q:** What‚Äôs the benefit of static methods in interfaces?
   **A:** They provide utility/helper methods related to the interface without affecting implementing classes.

---

### 5. Multiple Inheritance using interfaces

**Explanation:**

* Java supports multiple inheritance only through interfaces.
* A class can implement multiple interfaces.
* Avoids the diamond problem as interfaces do not hold state.
* Enables combining different behaviors from multiple sources.
* Useful in designing flexible systems with multiple capabilities.

**Use Case:**
A `SmartDevice` implementing both `Camera` and `Phone` interfaces to combine functionalities.

**Summary:**
Multiple inheritance with interfaces allows a class to inherit behavior from multiple sources without the complications of multiple class inheritance. It promotes flexible design and code reuse.

```java
interface Camera {
    void takePhoto();
}

interface Phone {
    void makeCall(String number);
}

class SmartDevice implements Camera, Phone {
    public void takePhoto() {
        System.out.println("Taking a photo");
    }

    public void makeCall(String number) {
        System.out.println("Calling " + number);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SmartDevice device = new SmartDevice();
        device.takePhoto();
        device.makeCall("123-456-7890");
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** How does Java support multiple inheritance?
   **A:** Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces, allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces.

2. **Q:** Why is multiple inheritance with classes not allowed in Java?
   **A:** To avoid ambiguity and the diamond problem that arises due to conflicting methods and state.

3. **Q:** Can interfaces have method implementations in multiple inheritance scenarios?
   **A:** Yes, since Java 8, interfaces can have default methods, but conflicts must be resolved by overriding.

---

### 6. Interface defines a new type

**Explanation:**

* Interfaces create new reference types.
* Objects of implementing classes can be referenced by the interface type.
* Enables polymorphism and dynamic method dispatch.
* Useful in writing flexible, decoupled code.
* Interfaces can be used as method parameters and return types.

**Use Case:**
Using `List` interface as a type rather than concrete `ArrayList` or `LinkedList`.

**Summary:**
Interfaces define new types that enable polymorphic behavior, allowing different classes to be used interchangeably if they implement the same interface. This promotes flexible, maintainable code design.

```java
interface Animal {
    void sound();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

class Cat implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void makeSound(Animal animal) {
        animal.sound();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Dog();
        Animal cat = new Cat();
        makeSound(dog);
        makeSound(cat);
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** What does it mean that an interface defines a new type?
   **A:** It means interfaces create a new reference type that classes implementing them can be assigned to.

2. **Q:** Why use interface types instead of concrete classes?
   **A:** To write more flexible and decoupled code that can work with any implementation of the interface.

3. **Q:** Can you instantiate an interface type?
   **A:** You cannot instantiate an interface directly, but you can create an instance of a class implementing the interface and reference it by the interface type.

---

### 7. Marker Interface

**Explanation:**

* Marker interfaces contain no methods or fields.
* Used to mark or tag a class for a special behavior.
* JVM or frameworks check for the presence of marker interfaces.
* Examples: `Serializable`, `Cloneable`.
* Enables metadata-like behavior without annotations.

**Use Case:**
Marking classes serializable by implementing `Serializable` interface.

**Summary:**
Marker interfaces act as metadata tags without defining methods, signaling to the JVM or frameworks to provide special handling of marked classes. It‚Äôs a legacy way of marking classes for behavior.

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

class Employee implements Serializable {
    int id;
    String name;
    
    Employee(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp = new Employee(101, "John");
        if(emp instanceof Serializable) {
            System.out.println("Employee can be serialized.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** What is a marker interface?
   **A:** An interface with no methods used to mark classes for special behavior.

2. **Q:** Give an example of a marker interface.
   **A:** `Serializable`, `Cloneable`.

3. **Q:** Why were marker interfaces used before annotations?
   **A:** To provide metadata to the JVM or frameworks before annotations were introduced in Java 5.

---

### 8. \[JAVA 8] Functional Interface

**Explanation:**

* Functional interface has exactly one abstract method.
* Can contain default and static methods.
* Used as the target for lambda expressions.
* Annotated with `@FunctionalInterface` for clarity.
* Enables functional programming style in Java.

**Use Case:**
Using `Runnable` or custom functional interface with lambda expressions.

**Summary:**
Functional interfaces enable the use of lambda expressions and method references, bringing functional programming capabilities to Java. They provide a concise way to implement single-method interfaces.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Calculator {
    int calculate(int a, int b);
    
    default void description() {
        System.out.println("Performs calculation on two integers.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator add = (a, b) -> a + b;
        System.out.println("Sum: " + add.calculate(5, 3));
        add.description();
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** What is a functional interface?
   **A:** An interface with exactly one abstract method, used as the target for lambda expressions.

2. **Q:** Can functional interfaces have default methods?
   **A:** Yes, default and static methods are allowed.

3. **Q:** What is the purpose of `@FunctionalInterface` annotation?
   **A:** To indicate the interface is intended to be functional and cause a compile-time error if not.

### 9. Class Vs Abstract Class Vs Interface

**Explanation:**

| Aspect               | Class                   | Abstract Class             | Interface                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Instantiation        | Can be instantiated     | Cannot be instantiated     | Cannot be instantiated       |
| Methods              | Concrete methods        | Abstract and concrete      | Abstract, default, static    |
| Multiple Inheritance | No                      | No                         | Yes (multiple interfaces)    |
| Fields               | Instance variables      | Instance variables allowed | Only static final constants  |
| Use case             | Complete implementation | Partial implementation     | Define contract for behavior |

**Use Case:**
Choose interface to define capabilities, abstract class for shared base implementation, class for concrete objects.

**Summary:**
Classes, abstract classes, and interfaces serve different purposes. Classes provide full implementation, abstract classes provide partial implementation and state, and interfaces define contracts. Understanding when to use each is key to good design.

```java
interface Flyer {
    void fly();
}

abstract class Bird implements Flyer {
    public void layEggs() {
        System.out.println("Laying eggs");
    }
}

class Eagle extends Bird {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Eagle is flying");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Eagle eagle = new Eagle();
        eagle.layEggs();
        eagle.fly();
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** Can a class extend multiple classes or interfaces?
   **A:** A class can extend only one class but can implement multiple interfaces.

2. **Q:** When would you use an abstract class over an interface?
   **A:** When you need to share code among closely related classes with state or behavior.

3. **Q:** Can interfaces have constructors?
   **A:** No, interfaces cannot have constructors.

Sure! Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown for **Section 12: Arrays in Java** with real-time use cases, explanations, summaries, sample codes, and interview Q\&A for each topic.

---

## 1. What is an Array in Java

### Explanation with Use Case

* Arrays in Java are data structures that hold a fixed number of elements of the same data type.
* They provide a way to store multiple values under a single variable name.
* Useful in scenarios like storing a list of temperatures, names, or any related collection of data.

* You can declare and initialize separately or together.
* Initialization can be done using `new` keyword or directly with values.
* Use cases: Storing a list of fixed configuration values or constants.

### Summary

In Java, arrays are declared by specifying the data type followed by square brackets. Initialization can be done either by allocating memory with `new` or by assigning values directly. This flexibility helps in scenarios like setting up predefined lists or dynamically allocating arrays during runtime.

### Code Example

```java
// Declaration
int[] numbers; 

// Initialization with new
numbers = new int[3]; 
numbers[0] = 10;
numbers[1] = 20;
numbers[2] = 30;

// Declaration and initialization together
int[] scores = {90, 80, 70};
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** How do you declare an array in Java?
   **A:** `datatype[] arrayName;` or `datatype arrayName[];`

2. **Q:** Can you initialize an array at the time of declaration?
   **A:** Yes, e.g., `int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};`

3. **Q:** What happens if you access an array index out of bounds?

**Real‚Äëtime use case**: Reading a configuration value as an integer.

* üö´ User may enter non-numeric value.
* Prevents input crashes.
* Graceful message rather than program halt.
* Shows early value validation.
* Sets a default fallback when input invalid.

**Summary**:

1. Wrap conversion in `try`.
2. Catch `NumberFormatException`.
3. Provide user-friendly feedback.
4. Use default if conversion fails.
5. Avoid unexpected crash.

**Code**:

```java
String input = "abc"; 
int value;
try {
    value = Integer.parseInt(input);
} catch (NumberFormatException e) {
    System.out.println("Invalid number; using default 0");
    value = 0;
}
System.out.println("Value = " + value);
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: What exception does `parseInt` throw on bad input?
   **A**: `NumberFormatException`, an unchecked runtime exception.
2. **Q**: Why catch it early?
   **A**: To prevent crash and handle fallback logic gracefully.
3. **Q**: Unchecked vs checked?
   **A**: Unchecked (runtime) aren‚Äôt forced to be caught or declared.

---

## 2. try‚Äëcatch Block

**Real‚Äëtime use case**: File-reading to parse lines.

* I/O may fail (file not found).
* Parsing may fail.
* Allows separate handling of I/O vs parsing.
* Keeps program alive if minor error.
* Easy resource management with finally.

**Summary**:

1. Place risky I/O in `try`.
2. Each failure handled in its `catch`.
3. Continue execution after handling.
4. Clear messages for each error.
5. Simple structure for multiple failures.

**Code**:

```java
try {
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("data.txt"));
    String line = br.readLine();
    int x = Integer.parseInt(line);
    br.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    System.out.println("File missing");
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("I/O error");
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Can a single `try` have multiple `catch` blocks?
   **A**: Yes, to handle different exception types.
2. **Q**: Catching `Exception` vs specific?
   **A**: Specific ensures targeted handling; broad may mask issues.
3. **Q**: Can `catch` change return value?
   **A**: Yes, you can modify variables or return values inside catch.

---

## 3. Multiple catch Blocks

**Real‚Äëtime use case**: Network call then parse JSON.

* Network fails ‚Üí `IOException`.
* JSON parse fails ‚Üí `JSONException`.
* Handle each independently.
* Fine‚Äëtune retry vs error.
* Clear error logging.

**Summary**:

1. One try covers multi-step risky ops.
2. Multiple catches catch specific exceptions.
3. Maintain separate recovery paths.
4. Clean and maintainable code.
5. Avoid clumping different errors together.

**Code**:

```java
try {
    String resp = readFromNetwork();
    JSONObject obj = new JSONObject(resp);
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("Network error");
} catch (JSONException e) {
    System.out.println("Bad JSON format");
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Order of catch blocks?
   **A**: From most specific to most general.
2. **Q**: What if two catches same exception?
   **A**: Compiler error: duplicate catch block.
3. **Q**: Can catch a superclass exception after subclass?
   **A**: Yes; subclass first, then superclass.

---

## 4. finally Block

**Real‚Äëtime use case**: Ensure DB connection closes.

* DB always must close resource.
* Even if exception thrown.
* Prevent leaks and locks.
* Central place for cleanup.
* Keeps logic DRY.

**Summary**:

1. `finally` always executes (except `System.exit()`).
2. Place resource cleanup here.
3. Works with or without exception.
4. Good for logging end of process.
5. Avoid exceptions in finally itself.

**Code**:

```java
Connection conn = null;
try {
    conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url);
    // use conn
} catch (SQLException e) {
    System.out.println("DB error");
} finally {
    if (conn != null) try { conn.close(); } catch (SQLException ignored) {}
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Does `finally` run if return inside try?
   **A**: Yes.
2. **Q**: What if `finally` throws exception?
   **A**: It overrides any original exception unless suppressed.
3. **Q**: Can you skip `finally`?
   **A**: Only via `System.exit()` or power failure.

---

## 5. \[JAVA 7] try‚Äëwith‚Äëresources

**Real‚Äëtime use case**: Auto-close file reader.

* Auto-closes at end.
* Clean and compact syntax.
* Handles exceptions in close.
* Works with any `AutoCloseable`.
* Reduces resource leak risk.

**Summary**:

1. Declares resources in `try(...)`.
2. Automatically closed afterward.
3. Can have multiple resources.
4. Auto handles suppressed exceptions.
5. Cleaner syntax vs manual finally.

**Code**:

```java
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("data.txt"))) {
    System.out.println(br.readLine());
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("Error reading file");
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: What interfaces work with try‚Äëwith‚Äëresources?
   **A**: Anything implementing `AutoCloseable` or `Closeable`.
2. **Q**: How are suppressed exceptions handled?
   **A**: The primary is thrown; others are added via `Throwable.addSuppressed()`.
3. **Q**: Try‚Äëwith‚Äëresources vs finally?
   **A**: Auto closes, simpler and safer.

---

## 6. Rules while Handling Exceptions

**Real‚Äëtime use case**: Enforcing coding best practices.

* Don‚Äôt swallow exceptions.
* Log meaningful messages.
* Clean resources properly.
* Prefer specific catches.
* Use exception chaining (`e.initCause()`).

**Summary**:

1. Catch what you can handle.
2. Clean up resources.
3. Log context-rich info.
4. Avoid empty catches.
5. Don‚Äôt misuse exceptions for flow.

**Code**:

```java
try {
    doWork();
} catch (SpecificException e) {
    logger.error("Work failed due to X", e);
    throw new MyWrappedException("Attempt failed", e);
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Why wrap exceptions?
   **A**: To abstract internal errors and preserve stack trace.
2. **Q**: Is `catch(Exception e){}` ok?
   **A**: No‚Äîtoo broad; hides issues.
3. **Q**: When to rethrow?
   **A**: When you can‚Äôt handle it; let caller decide.

---

## 7. The Exception Hierarchy

**Real‚Äëtime use case**: Designing custom exceptions.

* Know base classes.
* Choose correct branch: checked vs unchecked.
* Ensures caller awareness.
* Avoid misuse of `Error`.
* Helps grouping in catches.

**Summary**:

1. Base is `Throwable`.
2. Two branches: `Error` (critical) and `Exception`.
3. Under `Exception`: checked and runtime.
4. Use checked for recoverable issues.
5. Unchecked for programmer errors.

**Code**:

```java
class MyException extends Exception {}  // checked
class MyRuntimeException extends RuntimeException {}  // unchecked
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Difference `Exception` vs `RuntimeException`?
   **A**: Runtime not required to be declared or caught.
2. **Q**: Should you create custom Error?
   **A**: No‚ÄîError is for JVM-level faults.
3. **Q**: Where does `IOException` reside?
   **A**: Under checked `Exception`.

---

## 8. Checked Exceptions

**Real‚Äëtime use case**: JDBC SQL operations.

* Caller must explicitly handle or declare.
* Enforces compile-time handling.
* Promotes robust code.
* Forces error consideration.
* Avoid overusing checked exceptions.

**Summary**:

1. Compiler forces catch/declare.
2. Good for expected recoverable errors.
3. Encourage explicit handling.
4. Misuse leads to verbose code.
5. Use selectively.

**Code**:

```java
void load() throws IOException {
    Files.readAllLines(Path.of("x.txt"));
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Can you convert checked to unchecked?
   **A**: Yes, by wrapping in `RuntimeException`.
2. **Q**: Is `SQLException` checked or unchecked?
   **A**: Checked.
3. **Q**: Why not make everything checked?
   **A**: Leads to boilerplate and limits flexibility.

---

## 9. Unchecked Exceptions

**Real‚Äëtime use case**: Handling array index issues.

* Prevents programmer errors.
* No compile‚Äëtime forcing.
* Simplicity in code.
* Caller should fix bug, not handle.
* Examples: NPE, AIOOBE.

**Summary**:

1. Extend `RuntimeException`.
2. No need to declare.
3. Used for programming errors.
4. Fix bug instead of catching.
5. Cleaner APIs.

**Code**:

```java
if (arr == null) throw new NullPointerException("arr is null");
int x = arr[i];  // may throw AIOOBE
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Should you catch NPE?
   **A**: No; better fix null upstream.
2. **Q**: When to throw `IllegalArgumentException`?
   **A**: On invalid method input.
3. **Q**: Are unchecked exceptions propagated?
   **A**: Yes, until caught or kill thread.

---

## 10. `throws` Keyword

**Real‚Äëtime use case**: File parsing API design.

* Documents exceptions in signature.
* Caller knows to handle.
* Keeps method clean.
* Enforces error handling further up.
* Useful in library methods.

**Summary**:

1. Declares exceptions a method can throw.
2. Only for checked exceptions.
3. Forces call site to catch or declare.
4. Inherited methods must not narrow exceptions.
5. Improves code readability.

**Code**:

```java
public List<String> readLines(File f) throws IOException {
    return Files.readAllLines(f.toPath());
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Can you declare unchecked in `throws`?
   **A**: Yes, but optional.
2. **Q**: Override method can throw more?
   **A**: Can throw fewer or narrower exceptions.
3. **Q**: What if caller ignores?
   **A**: Compile-time error unless covered.

---

## 11. `throw` Keyword

**Real‚Äëtime use case**: Validate user input.

* Check invalid state.
* Immediately signal issue.
* Stops further processing.
* Caller must handle.
* Useful for guard clauses.

**Summary**:

1. Used to explicitly fire an exception.
2. Followed by `new` operator.
3. Typically Runtime for precondition failure.
4. Prevents invalid states.
5. Helps enforce API contract.

**Code**:

```java
public void setAge(int age) {
    if (age < 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age >= 0 required");
    this.age = age;
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Difference `throws` vs `throw`?
   **A**: `throws` declares, `throw` launches.
2. **Q**: Can you throw null?
   **A**: Throws `NullPointerException` at runtime.
3. **Q**: Throwing checked vs unchecked?
   **A**: Checked must be declared/caught; unchecked don't.

---

### ‚úÖ Final Note:

Below are detailed sections covering each topic with real-world examples, five bullet-point explanations, a five-line summary, end‚Äëof‚Äësummary code snippets, and three interview questions with answers.

---

## 1. **Differences between `throw` and `throws` keyword**

**Real‚Äëtime use case**: Validating input in a library method.

* `throw` actually *raises* an exception instance at runtime.
* `throws` *declares* in a method signature what checked exceptions MAY be thrown.
* You `throw new Exception(...)`, but `public void foo() throws Exception`.
* Callers must catch or re-declare exceptions declared with `throws`.
* You can declare multiple exceptions using `throws A, B, C`.

**Summary**:
`throw` actively triggers an exception during execution; `throws` merely informs callers that the method might generate specific checked exceptions. `throw` is placed inside method body; `throws` appears in the signature. Only checked exceptions need to be declared with `throws`, but both keywords form a contract: *you throw*, *I know what to handle*. They complement each other in method design.

**Code**:

```java
public void parseAge(String s) throws NumberFormatException {
    int age = Integer.parseInt(s);  // NumberFormatException is thrown
    if(age < 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("age >= 0");
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Can you use `throw` in a method with no `throws` declaration?
   **A**: Yes‚Äîbut only for unchecked exceptions. Checked ones must be declared.
2. **Q**: Can a method that declares `throws IOException` throw `Exception`?
   **A**: No, broader exceptions not declared unless method signature allows it.
3. **Q**: Is `throws RuntimeException` necessary?
   **A**: No‚Äîit's optional; unchecked exceptions don‚Äôt require declaration.

---

## 2. **Exception Propagation**

**Real‚Äëtime use case**: Multi-layered service calls (UI ‚Üí service ‚Üí DAO).

* Exceptions bubble up the call stack if not handled.
* Each caller can choose to catch or pass along.
* Enables separation: low-level throws, high-level handles.
* Prevents duplication of error handling logic.
* Allows centralized error handling (e.g., UI layer).

**Summary**:
Exception propagation is the automatic passing of an unhandled exception up the call stack until it's caught or reaches the JVM. It enables layered architecture: deeper layers throw, outer layers catch. It avoids cluttering lower code with unrelated error handling. Propagation can be controlled with `throws` or `catch`, giving flexibility in where to manage errors.

**Code**:

```java
public void uiAction() {
    try {
        service.doWork();
    } catch(ServiceException e) {
        System.out.println("UI: Could not complete action");
    }
}
public void doWork() throws ServiceException {
    dao.loadData();    // may throw DAOException
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: What happens if no catch in application?
   **A**: JVM catches it and terminates the thread or prints stack trace.
2. **Q**: How to propagate a caught exception?
   **A**: Use `throw e;` or wrap and rethrow (`throw new X(e);`).
3. **Q**: Can you propagate unchecked exceptions?
   **A**: Yes, automatically or explicitly, without declaration.

---

## 3. **Nested try block**

**Real‚Äëtime use case**: HTTP request with parsing and resource cleanup.

* Encapsulates different risk areas separately.
* Inner `try` handles I/O, outer handles post-processing.
* Can have its own `finally` for cleanup.
* Avoids one block catching too many exceptions.
* Enables fine-grained recovery strategies.

**Summary**:
Nested try blocks allow isolated handling of distinct operations: e.g., network I/O vs parsing. Each block can manage its own exceptions and cleanup, reducing complexity and avoiding interference. This pattern keeps low‚Äëlevel concerns separated from higher‚Äëlevel error handling, enhancing clarity and control.

**Code**:

```java
try {
    connection.open();
    try {
        String r = connection.read();
        data = JSON.parse(r);
    } catch(IOException e) {
        System.out.println("Network read error");
    } finally {
        connection.close();
    }
} catch(ParseException e) {
    System.out.println("Invalid data format");
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Is nesting always recommended?
   **A**: Only when distinct operations need own handling or cleanup.
2. **Q**: What if inner `finally` throws?
   **A**: It overrides any previous exception unless suppressed.
3. **Q**: Can nested `try` skip catches?
   **A**: Yes; you can include inner `try` without its own `catch`.

---

## 4. **Custom Checked Exception**

**Real‚Äëtime use case**: Payment validation in banking app.

* Defined by extending `Exception` (checked).
* Forces caller to catch or declare it.
* Suitable for recoverable business faults.
* Can include error codes or context data.
* Improves API clarity and documentation.

**Summary**:
Checked custom exceptions are ideal for business-logic issues the caller should handle (e.g., insufficient funds). By extending `Exception`, you enforce handling at compile time. You can enrich them with codes or metadata. This improves robustness and readability by distinguishing expected failures from programmer errors.

**Code**:

```java
class PaymentException extends Exception {
    public PaymentException(String msg){ super(msg); }
}
public void pay(double amount) throws PaymentException {
    if(amount > balance) throw new PaymentException("Insufficient funds");
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Should every custom exception be checked?
   **A**: No‚Äîonly when callers should recover or handle it.
2. **Q**: How to add error codes?
   **A**: Add fields + getters; set in constructor.
3. **Q**: How to catch multiple custom exceptions?
   **A**: Use multiple catches or catch a common superclass.

---

## 5. **Custom Unchecked Exception**

**Real‚Äëtime use case**: Internal API misuse detection.

* Extend `RuntimeException`.
* Thrown for wrong use by programmer‚Äîe.g., illegal state.
* Doesn‚Äôt require `throws`; caller needn‚Äôt handle.
* Safe to use in low-level utility code.
* Promotes fail-fast philosophy.

**Summary**:
Custom unchecked exceptions (extending `RuntimeException`) are ideal for signaling programming errors or API misuse. They allow callers to ignore catching if they prefer. This promotes cleaner APIs and encourages early failure during development. They carry full stack trace for debugging.

**Code**:

```java
class InvalidConfigException extends RuntimeException {
    public InvalidConfigException(String m){ super(m); }
}
public void setConfig(Config c) {
    if(c == null) throw new InvalidConfigException("Config required");
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: When to use checked vs unchecked?
   **A**: Use unchecked for programming errors, checked for recoverable conditions.
2. **Q**: Do callers have to catch unchecked?
   **A**: No‚Äîthey can, but it‚Äôs optional.
3. **Q**: What about API design?
   **A**: Unchecked makes methods simpler; checked enforces explicit error handling.

---

## 6. **`final`, `finally` and `finalize`**

**Real‚Äëtime use case**: Immutable data, cleanup, and object cleanup fallback.

* `final`: ensures variable unchangeable, method non-overridable.
* `finally`: block that runs after try/catch for cleanup.
* `finalize()`: legacy method invoked before GC (deprecated in Java‚ÄØ9+).
* `finally` is reliable cleanup; `finalize()` is unpredictable.
* Prefer `try-with-resources` and `final` for safety.

**Summary**:
`final` secures invariants, prevents extension. `finally` guarantees code execution after exceptions for cleaning. `finalize()` was an unreliable destructor alternative‚Äîdeprecated now in favor of other mechanisms (e.g., AutoCloseable). Use `final` and `finally` appropriately; avoid `finalize()` in production.

**Code**:

```java
public final class User {
    private final String name;
    public User(String n){ name = n; }
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("Cleaning");  // legacy GC hook
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Why avoid `finalize()`?
   **A**: It‚Äôs unpredictable, often too late, and has performance impact.
2. **Q**: When is `finally` not executed?
   **A**: If `System.exit()` runs or thread is killed.
3. **Q**: Can a `final` method be overridden?
   **A**: No‚Äî`final` prevents overriding in subclasses.

                                      Section 15: Unmasking Java's Superclass(java.lang.Object) Secrets

Sure! Here‚Äôs a comprehensive breakdown of **Section 15: Unmasking Java‚Äôs Superclass (java.lang.Object) Secrets**, covering each topic with real-time coding examples, 5 bullet‚Äëpoint explanations, a 5‚Äëline summary with sample code, and 3 interview Q\&A per section. Let me know if you'd like code in specific versions or environments!

---

## 1. Introduction to the methods in `Object` class

**Key methods in `Object`:**

```java
public int hashCode();
public boolean equals(Object obj);
public String toString();
protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException;
protected void finalize() throws Throwable;
public final Class<?> getClass();
```

**5 bullet-point explanations:**

* Provides foundational behavior for all Java objects.
* `hashCode()` + `equals()` define object equality and hashing contracts.
* `toString()` offers text representation, often overridden.
* `clone()` enables object duplication; `finalize()` for cleanup before GC.
* `getClass()` retrieves runtime type info.

**5‚Äëline summary + code:**

* The `Object` class is the root superclass of all Java classes.
* It provides core methods that enable polymorphic behavior across types.
* Overriding `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` tailors object operations.
* `clone` and `finalize` support lifecycle and cleanup management.
* `getClass()` returns runtime type for reflection and type checks.

```java
Object o = new Object();
System.out.println(o.getClass()); // class java.lang.Object
System.out.println(o.toString()); // java.lang.Object@<hexhash>
```

**3 interview Q\&A:**

1. *Why does every class inherit from `Object`?*
   Ensures common behavior (e.g. equals, hashCode) across all objects, supports polymorphism.

2. *What happens if you call `clone()` on an object that doesn‚Äôt support it?*
   Throws `CloneNotSupportedException` unless the class implements `Cloneable`.

3. *Is `finalize()` recommended for cleanup?*
   No ‚Äî unpredictable, deprecated in newer Java; prefer try-with-resources or `cleaner`.

---

## 2. Deep dive on `getClass()`

**5 bullet-point explanations:**

* Returns a `Class<?>` object representing the runtime class.
* Final method, cannot be overridden.
* Used for type checks (`obj.getClass() == SomeClass.class`).
* Safer than `instanceof` when exact type is required.
* Supports reflection: `getDeclaredMethods()`, `getFields()`, etc.

**5‚Äëline summary + code:**

* `getClass()` is final and returns the exact runtime type.
* Useful for runtime checks or logging type names.
* Prevents downcasting errors by verifying class equality.
* Enables reflective operations like instantiating or inspecting.
* Always returns non-null.

```java
Object s = "hello";
System.out.println(s.getClass().getName()); // java.lang.String
```

**3 interview Q\&A:**

1. *Can `getClass()` be overridden?*
   No ‚Äî it's final in `Object`.
2. *Difference between `getClass()` and `instanceof`?*
   `getClass()` checks exact runtime class; `instanceof` checks subclass relationships.
3. *Why `getClass()` never returns null?*
   It's invoked on an existing instance, so `this` is non-null.

---

## 3. Deep dive on `hashCode()`

**5 bullet-point explanations:**

* Provides an integer hash code for objects.
* Default implementation often derived from memory address.
* Must be consistent with `equals()`: equal objects produce same hash.
* Used in hash-based collections like `HashMap`, `HashSet`.
* Collisions possible; but proper implementation improves distribution.

**5‚Äëline summary + code:**

* `hashCode()` returns a number used in maps and sets.
* Overriding ensures objects with same state have same hash.
* Poor `hashCode()` impacts performance due to collisions.
* Should use all relevant fields in computation.
* Always return same hash for same object state unless mutated.

```java
class P{ int x, y;
  public int hashCode(){ return 31 * x + y; }
}
```

**3 interview Q\&A:**

1. *What are hashCode contracts?*
   Equal objects must have same hash; unequal can differ; stable during object's lifetime.
2. *What if two objects have same hash?*
   It's a collision: they go to same bucket and are compared via `equals()`.
3. *What happens if you override `equals` but not `hashCode`?*
   Violates contract and leads to inconsistent behavior in hash-based collections.

---

## 4. Deep dive on `equals()`

**5 bullet-point explanations:**

* Determines semantic equality between objects.
* Default compares references (`this == obj`).
* Must satisfy reflexive, symmetric, transitive, consistent, non-nullity.
* Commonly overridden to compare relevant fields.
* When overriding, consider using `instanceof` or `getClass()`.

**5‚Äëline summary + code:**

* `equals()` expresses domain-specific equality.
* Default identity check is often insufficient.
* Proper override uses comprehensive field comparisons.
* Must maintain `hashCode()` consistency.
* Avoid null dereference by checking `if (obj == this)` early.

```java
@Override public boolean equals(Object o){
  if(this == o) return true;
  if(!(o instanceof P)) return false;
  P p = (P) o;
  return x == p.x && y == p.y;
}
```

**3 interview Q\&A:**

1. *Why check `this == o`?*
   Quick check to handle reflexivity and improve performance.
2. *Use `instanceof` or `getClass()`?*
   `instanceof` allows subclass equality; `getClass()` enforces exact match.
3. *Why check `o == null`?*
   To ensure `equals(null)` returns false, fulfilling non-nullity clause.

---

## 5. Override `hashCode()` & `equals()` methods

**5 bullet-point explanations:**

* Ensures proper behavior in collections.
* IDEs can auto‚Äëgenerate robust implementations.
* Should include all fields that define object identity.
* Use prime multipliers (like 31) for `hashCode`.
* Follow good coding conventions to avoid subtle bugs.

**5‚Äëline summary + code:**

* Always override both `equals` and `hashCode` together.
* Use all significant fields for comparisons and hash generation.
* IDE tools help avoid mistakes and boilerplate.
* Null checks and type comparisons are essential.
* Ensures correctness in `HashMap`, `HashSet`, etc.

```java
@Override public int hashCode(){
  return Objects.hash(x, y, name);
}
```

**3 interview Q\&A:**

1. *Why always override both?*
   To maintain the general contract: equal ‚Üí equal hash.
2. *What tools help generate them?*
   IDEs like IntelliJ, Eclipse, or `Objects.equals` and `Objects.hash`.
3. *Can hashCode be negative?*
   Yes, it can return any `int`, including negative.

---

## 6. Override `hashCode()` & `equals()` using IntelliJ

**5 bullet-point explanations:**

* IntelliJ auto-generates `equals()` and `hashCode()` via **Code ‚Üí Generate**.
* Offers templates using `Objects` utility class.
* Lets you choose which fields contribute to identity.
* Ensures proper ordering and null-check correctness.
* Provides quick, tested, maintainable implementations.

**5‚Äëline summary + code:**

* IntelliJ automates override generation: saves time and reduces errors.
* Allows field selection for identity logic.
* Generates robust, well-structured methods.
* Includes null safety and proper type handling.
* Keeps code consistent and maintainable.

```java
@Override public int hashCode(){
  return Objects.hash(x, y, name);
}
@Override public boolean equals(Object o){ /* generated */ }
```

**3 interview Q\&A:**

1. *Can IDE generation be trusted?*
   Yes‚ÄîIDEs generate correct, performance‚Äëbalanced code.
2. *What if new fields are added later?*
   Regenerate methods to include new fields.
3. *Is manual tweaking needed?*
   Only if custom logic (e.g. case‚Äëinsensitive comparison) is required.

---

## 7. Deep dive on `toString()`

**5 bullet-point explanations:**

* Default returns `Classname@hexHashCode`.
* Overriding improves readability, especially in logs.
* Include important field values.
* Auto-generated by IDEs or libraries like Lombok.
* Useful for debugging, logging, and diagnostics.

**5‚Äëline summary + code:**

* `toString()` should reflect object content meaningfully.
* Simplifies debugging and makes logs human‚Äëreadable.
* Include only essential, non-sensitive fields.
* Avoid heavy computation or formatting in `toString()`.
* Override using IDEs or libraries for consistency.

```java
@Override public String toString(){
  return "P{x=" + x + ", y=" + y + ", name='" + name + "'}";
}
```

**3 interview Q\&A:**

1. *Why override `toString()`?*
   To produce clear, informative output for debugging.
2. *What should `toString()` not do?*
   Avoid heavy logic, I/O, or revealing sensitive info.
3. *Use auto-generation tools?*
   Yes, IDEs or Lombok‚Äôs `@ToString` are helpful.

---

## 8. Demo: `hashCode()`, `equals()` & `toString()` of `String`

**5 bullet-point explanations:**

* `String#hashCode()` is computed from character sequence:
  `s[0]*31^(n-1) + s[1]*31^(n-2) + ‚Ä¶`
* `equals()` checks length and content equality.
* `toString()` returns the same string object.
* Immutable nature ensures safe, consistent behavior.
* Enables `HashMap<String, V>` use and reliable logging.

**5‚Äëline summary + code:**

* `String` overrides all three methods for predictable behavior.
* Hash computed based on characters‚Äîcontent-based.
* `equals()` checks exact character-by-character match.
* `toString()` just returns the original string.
* Immutable strings guarantee reliable hashing and equality.

```java
String a = "Hi";
String b = new String("Hi");
System.out.println(a.hashCode() == b.hashCode()); // true
System.out.println(a.equals(b)); // true
System.out.println(a.toString()); // Hi
```

**3 interview Q\&A:**

1. *How is `String.hashCode()` implemented?*
   As a polynomial rolling hash on character array.
2. *Is `equals()` case-sensitive?*
   Yes‚Äîcompares actual characters.
3. *Does `a == b` hold here?*
   Only if interned; else, false because they‚Äôre different objects.

## 9. Deep dive on `finalize()`

**5 bullet-point explanations:**

* Called by GC before object is reclaimed.
* Unreliable timing and not guaranteed to run promptly.
* Deprecated since Java‚ÄØ9 and removed in Java‚ÄØ18.
* Risky for resource cleanup (use `try-with-resources` instead).
* Can resurrect the object, complicating GC.

**5‚Äëline summary + code:**

* `finalize()` is unsafe and obsolete for cleanup.
* Its execution timing is unpredictable; may never run.
* Deprecated and removed‚Äîdon't rely on it.
* Use `AutoCloseable` and resource management instead.
* Only relevant for legacy code migration.

```java
@Override protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
  try { System.out.println("Cleanup"); }
  finally { super.finalize(); }
}
```

**3 interview Q\&A:**

1. *When is `finalize()` called?*
   At GC discretion; not reliably invoked.
2. *Why deprecated?*
   Due to unpredictability and safety concerns.
3. *Preferred alternative?*
   Use `AutoCloseable` with try‚Äëwith‚Äëresources or `Cleaner`.

## 10. Deep dive on `clone()`

**5 bullet-point explanations:**

* Creates a field-by-field copy (shallow) by default.
* Requires implementing `Cloneable`; throws exception otherwise.
* Override and call `super.clone()` to enable cloning.
* Use deep cloning manually if object contains mutable fields.
* Often replaced by copy constructors or serialization.

**5‚Äëline summary + code:**

* `clone()` automates shallow copying of objects.
* Must implement `Cloneable`; otherwise throws exception.
* Shallow clone duplicates object structure but not referenced objects.
* Override to customize or deep-copy mutable references.
* Many prefer copy constructors for clarity and safety.

```java
class C implements Cloneable {
  int x; List<String> list;
  protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
    C c = (C) super.clone();
    c.list = new ArrayList<>(list); // deep copy
    return c;
  }
}
```

**3 interview Q\&A:**

1. *Difference between shallow vs deep clone?*
   Shallow copies references; deep clones duplicate referenced objects.
2. *Why implement `Cloneable`?*
   To signal safe cloning; otherwise, `clone()` throws exception.
3. *Alternatives to `clone()`?*
   Use copy constructors, `cloneable` libraries, or serialization copy.

---

## 11. Details about Shallow cloning & Deep cloning

**5 bullet-point explanations:**

* **Shallow clone:** copies object, but fields reference shared sub‚Äëobjects.
* **Deep clone:** copies object and all nested objects recursively.
* Mutability of fields influences chosen clone type.
* Shallow clone is faster but riskier for shared state.
* Deep clone safer but more complex and performance costly.

**5‚Äëline summary + code:**

* Shallow clone copies primitive values; references remain shared.
* Deep clone duplicates entire object graph to isolate state.
* Choose shallow for immutable/reference-safe objects.
* Use deep when copying involves mutable components.
* Balanced cloning depends on use-case performance and safety.

```java
C a = new C(1, List.of("x"));
C b = (C) a.clone();
b.list.add("y"); // only affects b if deep‚Äëcloned
```

**3 interview Q\&A:**

1. *Risk with shallow clone?*
   Shared references can lead to unintended side effects.
2. *Deep clone downside?*
   Higher memory use and complex implementation.
3. *Best practice?*
   Use immutability or copy constructors when possible.

---

## 12. Mutable and Immutable objects

**5 bullet-point explanations:**

* **Mutable:** internal state can change (e.g., `StringBuilder`).
* **Immutable:** state never changes after creation (e.g., `String`).
* Immutable are thread-safe and hash-stable.
* Mutables require careful clone/equals/hashCode.
* Choose immutability for safety; mutability for flexibility/performance.

**5‚Äëline summary + code:**

* Immutable objects guarantee thread-safety and reliable caching.
* They support safe use in hash-based structures.
* Mutable objects allow in-place updates but need clone logic.
* Java classes (`String`, `Integer`) are immutable by design.
* Choose based on design: safety vs. efficiency and flexibility.

```java
String s = "abc"; // immutable
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("abc"); // mutable
```

**3 interview Q\&A:**

1. *Why use immutable classes?*
   Simplify concurrency, caching, and prevent unintended changes.
2. *Can you mutate an immutable?*
   No‚Äîonly create new instances on modification.

Arrays in Java are foundational, but they lack flexibility for modern data operations such as resizing, dynamic insertion/removal, or handling heterogeneous data types. This makes them less suitable for complex applications where data structure flexibility is crucial.

#### üìå Code Example:

```java
public class ArrayLimitationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] studentIds = new int[3];
        studentIds[0] = 101;
        studentIds[1] = 102;
        studentIds[2] = 103;
        // studentIds[3] = 104; // Error: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
        System.out.println("Fixed size array can't add more than 3 students.");
    }
}
```

#### üß† Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** What is the main limitation of arrays in Java?
   **A:** Arrays are fixed in size and cannot dynamically grow or shrink.

2. **Q:** Can arrays store mixed data types in Java?

## 7. ArrayList performance

### Real-time Use Case:

Analyzing the performance impact of frequent insertions/removals on large data like logs or sensor data streams.

### Explanation:

* ArrayList provides O(1) time for random access (`get`/`set`).
* Insertions/removals at the end are generally O(1).
* Insertions/removals in the middle or beginning are O(n) due to element shifts.
* Resizing (capacity growth) can cause performance hits during add.
* For frequent middle modifications, LinkedList might be better.

### Summary:

Understanding ArrayList performance characteristics is crucial for optimal application design. While it excels at random access and tail insertions, its costliest operations are insertions/removals at arbitrary positions due to array shifts. Proper use of initial capacity and operation patterns can minimize performance degradation.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ArrayListPerformance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>(1000);
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            numbers.add(i);
        }
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        numbers.add(500, 9999); // insertion in middle
        long end = System.nanoTime();
        System.out.println("Time taken for insertion: " + (end - start) + " ns");
    }
}
```

### Interview Questions & Answers:

1. **Q:** What is the time complexity of random access in ArrayList?
   **A:** O(1) constant time.

2. **Q:** Why are insertions in the middle of an ArrayList costly?
   **A:** Because elements have to be shifted, causing O(n) time complexity.

3. **Q:** How can you optimize ArrayList performance?
   **A:** By specifying initial capacity and minimizing middle insertions/removals.

## 1. \[JAVA 9] Creating Immutable Lists

### Use Case:

You want to create a fixed, unmodifiable list of user roles in an application to ensure no changes during runtime.

### Explanation:

* Immutable lists provide thread-safe collections without synchronization.
* Introduced in Java 9 via `List.of()` factory method.
* Attempts to modify the list throw `UnsupportedOperationException`.
* Immutable lists improve performance by avoiding defensive copies.
* Useful in configuration settings, constants, or fixed lookup values.

### Summary:

Java 9 introduced convenient methods to create immutable lists that cannot be altered after creation. This is ideal for constants or configurations where list data should remain stable throughout the program. Immutable lists also enhance thread safety without locking overhead. The syntax is concise, using `List.of()` with any number of elements. Attempting to add, remove, or modify the list causes runtime exceptions, enforcing immutability.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.List;

public class ImmutableListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> roles = List.of("Admin", "User", "Guest");
        System.out.println(roles);

        // roles.add("SuperAdmin"); // throws UnsupportedOperationException
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** What happens if you try to modify a list created by `List.of()`?
   **A:** It throws `UnsupportedOperationException` because the list is immutable.

2. **Q:** How is `List.of()` different from `Arrays.asList()`?
   **A:** `List.of()` creates an immutable list, while `Arrays.asList()` returns a fixed-size but mutable list backed by an array.

3. **Q:** Can you add null elements to a list created with `List.of()`?
   **A:** No, `List.of()` does not allow null elements; it throws a `NullPointerException`.

## 2. Iterate ArrayList using for-each and iterator()

### Use Case:

Traversing a list of customer names to print each name or apply some logic.

### Explanation:

* For-each loop is simple, concise, and best for read-only iteration.
* `Iterator` provides methods `hasNext()` and `next()` for manual traversal.
* `Iterator` allows safe element removal during iteration.
* For-each cannot modify collection during iteration safely.
* Iterator supports fail-fast behavior if the collection is modified externally.

### Summary:

Using a for-each loop is the most straightforward way to iterate over an ArrayList when no modifications are needed. For more control, especially when removing elements during iteration, the `Iterator` interface provides the necessary methods. The iterator ensures fail-fast behavior to detect concurrent modifications. Both methods are fundamental for traversing collections in Java.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Iterator;

public class IterateArrayListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> customers = new ArrayList<>();
        customers.add("Alice");
        customers.add("Bob");
        customers.add("Charlie");

        // For-each loop
        for (String customer : customers) {
            System.out.println(customer);
        }

        // Iterator
        Iterator<String> iterator = customers.iterator();
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            String cust = iterator.next();
            System.out.println(cust);
        }
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** When should you use an Iterator over a for-each loop?
   **A:** Use Iterator when you need to remove elements safely during iteration.

2. **Q:** What exception is thrown if the list is modified while iterating with Iterator?
   **A:** `ConcurrentModificationException`.

3. **Q:** Can you modify elements during a for-each loop?
   **A:** No, direct modification of the collection is unsafe during a for-each loop.

---

## 3. Iterate ArrayList using listIterator()

### Use Case:

You need to traverse an ArrayList both forward and backward, and possibly modify elements during iteration.

### Explanation:

* `ListIterator` extends `Iterator` with bidirectional traversal.
* Supports `hasNext()`, `next()`, `hasPrevious()`, `previous()`.
* Allows element insertion, update, and removal during iteration.
* Useful for complex list manipulations.
* Only applicable to `List` implementations (not plain `Iterator`).

### Summary:

The `ListIterator` interface provides powerful features for traversing lists in both directions and modifying elements during iteration. This makes it suitable for use cases like text editors, undo/redo stacks, or any scenario needing flexible list navigation. Unlike the simple iterator, it also supports adding and setting elements, enhancing control over list contents.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.ListIterator;

public class ListIteratorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
        names.add("John");
        names.add("Jane");
        names.add("Jack");

        ListIterator<String> listIterator = names.listIterator();

        System.out.println("Forward iteration:");
        while (listIterator.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(listIterator.next());
        }

        System.out.println("Backward iteration:");
        while (listIterator.hasPrevious()) {
            System.out.println(listIterator.previous());
        }
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** How does `ListIterator` differ from `Iterator`?
   **A:** `ListIterator` supports bidirectional traversal and modification of elements, whereas `Iterator` only supports forward traversal.

2. **Q:** Can you add elements using a `ListIterator`?
   **A:** Yes, using the `add()` method.

3. **Q:** Is `ListIterator` applicable to all Collection types?
   **A:** No, only to List implementations like ArrayList and LinkedList.

## 4. Sorting ArrayList using sort() methods

### Use Case:

Sort a list of product prices in ascending order to display on an e-commerce website.

### Explanation:

* Java 8 added `List.sort()` method for in-place sorting.
* Uses natural ordering if no Comparator is provided.
* Modifies the original list.
* Underlying sorting algorithm is TimSort (optimized merge sort).
* Simplifies sorting over `Collections.sort()` method.

### Summary:

The `List.sort()` method provides a clean, simple API for sorting lists in Java. By default, it uses natural ordering but can accept a custom Comparator. It sorts the list in place, making it efficient for direct modifications. This method is now preferred over older alternatives like `Collections.sort()` for its clarity and convenience.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class SortArrayListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Integer> prices = new ArrayList<>();
        prices.add(99);
        prices.add(45);
        prices.add(150);

        prices.sort(null); // natural ascending order
        System.out.println(prices); // Output: [45, 99, 150]
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** What sorting algorithm is used internally by `List.sort()`?
   **A:** TimSort, a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort.

2. **Q:** How do you sort in descending order using `List.sort()`?
   **A:** Pass a Comparator that reverses natural order, e.g., `Comparator.reverseOrder()`.

3. **Q:** Does `List.sort()` create a new list?
   **A:** No, it sorts the existing list in place.

---

## 5. Sorting ArrayList using custom Comparator

### Use Case:

Sort a list of employees by their salary in descending order.

### Explanation:

* Custom Comparator defines sorting logic.
* Implement `Comparator<T>` interface or use lambda.
* Comparator is passed to `sort()` for custom order.
* Allows multi-field sorting, e.g., by age then name.
* Enhances flexibility beyond natural ordering.

### Summary:

Custom comparators give control over how elements in a list are sorted, such as sorting by non-natural fields or in non-ascending order. In Java 8+, you can easily create comparators using lambdas or method references. This approach allows sorting on any attribute or combination of attributes, providing great flexibility for business logic.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Comparator;

class Employee {
    String name;
    int salary;

    Employee(String name, int salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return name + ": " + salary;
    }
}

public class CustomComparatorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();
        employees.add(new Employee("John", 5000));
        employees.add(new Employee("Jane", 7000));
        employees.add(new Employee("Doe", 6000));

        employees.sort((e1, e2) -> e2.salary - e1.salary); // descending by salary

        employees.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** What method must a Comparator implement?
   **A:** `int compare(T o1, T o2)`.

2. **Q:** Can you chain comparators?
   **A:** Yes, using `thenComparing()` method.

3. **Q:** How do you reverse a Comparator order?
   **A:** Use `Comparator.reversed()`.

## 6. Sorting ArrayList of custom data type using Comparable

### Use Case:

Sort a list of books by their natural order, e.g., by title alphabetically.

### Explanation:

* Implement `Comparable<T>` interface on the custom class.
* Override `compareTo()` to define natural ordering.
* Allows usage of default sorting methods without explicit Comparator.
* Only one natural ordering per class is possible.
* Simplifies sorting if a consistent order is required.

### Summary:

Implementing the `Comparable` interface allows custom objects to define their natural sort order. This makes them compatible with all sorting utilities that rely on natural order. It‚Äôs a simple and standard way to sort objects when only one logical sorting order is needed. However, for multiple sorting criteria, comparators are preferred.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;

class Book implements Comparable<Book> {
    String title;

    Book(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Book other) {
        return this.title.compareTo(other.title);
    }

    public String toString() {
        return title;
    }
}

public class ComparableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();
        books.add(new Book("Java Programming"));
        books.add(new Book("Data Structures"));
        books.add(new Book("Algorithms"));

        Collections.sort(books);

        books.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** What method must be implemented for `Comparable`?
   **A:** `int compareTo(T o)`.

2. **Q:** What exception might be thrown if `compareTo` is inconsistent?
   **A:** `IllegalArgumentException` or unexpected sorting behavior.

3. **Q:** Can a class implement both Comparable and use Comparator?
   **A:** Yes, Comparable defines natural order; Comparator allows custom orders.

## 7. Sorting ArrayList of custom data type using Comparator

### Use Case:

Sort a list of students by their grades, but also by age as a tiebreaker.

### Explanation:

* Comparator supports multiple sorting rules easily.
* Can be implemented as anonymous class or lambda.
* Supports chaining with `thenComparing()`.
* Does not modify the custom class source code.
* Great for dynamic sorting without changing domain objects.

### Summary:

Using Comparator provides flexibility to sort custom objects on various attributes without modifying the object's class. It supports chaining to apply secondary sorting rules and can be used inline with lambdas for concise code. This makes Comparator ideal when multiple or dynamic sorting criteria are needed, offering reusable and clear sorting logic.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Comparator;

class Student {
    String name;
    int grade;
    int age;

    Student(String name, int grade, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.grade = grade;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return name + " - " + grade + " - " + age;
    }
}

public class ComparatorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
        students.add(new Student("Alice", 90, 20));
        students.add(new Student("Bob", 90, 19));
        students.add(new Student("Charlie", 85, 22));

        students.sort(
            Comparator.comparingInt((Student s) -> s.grade)
                      .reversed()
                      .thenComparingInt(s -> s.age)
        );

        students.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

## 8. Arrays vs ArrayList

### Use Case:

Choosing between a fixed-size collection or a dynamically sized one for storing user input data.

### Explanation:

* Arrays have fixed length, ArrayList can grow dynamically.
* Arrays support primitives, ArrayList only supports objects.
* ArrayList provides many utility methods like add, remove, contains.
* Arrays are faster and use less memory.
* ArrayList implements List interface, enabling flexible operations.

### Summary:

Arrays are basic, fixed-size data structures with efficient memory usage and support for primitives. ArrayLists are dynamic, flexible collections that grow as needed and offer powerful utility methods but only for objects. Arrays are better for performance-critical, fixed-size needs, while ArrayLists are preferred for dynamic and frequent modifications. Choosing depends on specific application requirements.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class ArraysVsArrayListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Array example (fixed size)
        int[] numbersArray = {1, 2, 3};

        // ArrayList example (dynamic size)
        ArrayList<Integer> numbersList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3));
        numbersList.add(4);

        System.out.println("Array: " + Arrays.toString(numbersArray));
        System.out.println("ArrayList: " + numbersList);
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** Can ArrayList store primitive types?
   **A:** No, it stores wrapper objects like Integer instead.

2. **Q:** Which is faster: Array or ArrayList?
   **A:** Array is faster due to less overhead.

3. **Q:** How do you convert an Array to an ArrayList?
   **A:** Use `Arrays.asList(array)` method.

* Best suited for queues, stacks, and non-index-based collections.

### Summary:

LinkedLists excel in insertion and deletion efficiency but fall short in random access speed. Their performance profile must be matched carefully to application requirements.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class LinkedListPerformance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedList<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();

        long start = System.nanoTime();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            list.addFirst(i);
        }
        long end = System.nanoTime();

        System.out.println("Time to add 10,000 elements at start: " + (end - start) + " ns");
    }
}
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **What operations are LinkedLists good at?**
   Fast insertions and deletions at the start or end.

2. **Why is random access slow in LinkedList?**
   Because it requires traversal from head to desired index.

3. **Does LinkedList consume more memory than ArrayList? Why?**
   Yes, due to storing additional pointers for each node.

## 7. ArrayList vs LinkedList

### Real-time Use Case:

Choosing the right list implementation for a contact management app that mostly reads contacts but occasionally adds/removes them.

### Explanation:

| Feature              | ArrayList                  | LinkedList                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Access time          | O(1) random access         | O(n) random access           |
| Insertions/deletions | O(n) in middle             | O(1) at ends, O(n) in middle |
| Memory usage         | Less                       | More (pointers overhead)     |
| Internal structure   | Dynamic array              | Doubly linked nodes          |
| Use case             | Frequent access, rare mods | Frequent insert/delete       |

### Summary:

Choosing between ArrayList and LinkedList depends on usage patterns. For frequent random access, ArrayList is better; for frequent modifications, LinkedList excels.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class ListComparison {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Integer> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();
        LinkedList<Integer> linkedList = new LinkedList<>();

        // Adding elements
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            arrayList.add(i);
            linkedList.add(i);
        }

        // Access test
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        int x = arrayList.get(5000);
        long end = System.nanoTime();
        System.out.println("ArrayList get: " + (end - start) + " ns");

        start = System.nanoTime();
        x = linkedList.get(5000);
        end = System.nanoTime();
        System.out.println("LinkedList get: " + (end - start) + " ns");
    }
}
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **When would you prefer ArrayList over LinkedList?**
   When frequent random access is required.

2. **Why is LinkedList preferred for frequent insertions/deletions?**
   Because it maintains pointers allowing O(1) insert/delete at ends.

3. **Which one uses more memory and why?**
   LinkedList uses more memory due to extra node pointers.

                                                    Section 19: Generics in Java

Got it! Here‚Äôs a full detailed explanation for **Section 19: Generics in Java**, including real-time use cases, bullet point explanations, summaries, code, and interview Q\&A for each sub-topic.

---

## 1. Introduction to Generics in Java

### Real-time Use Case:

Creating type-safe collections in a banking application to store only `Transaction` objects, avoiding runtime type errors.

### Explanation:

* Generics enable **parameterized types**, allowing classes, interfaces, and methods to operate on any defined type.
* Helps in **compile-time type checking** to avoid ClassCastException.
* Makes code **reusable** and **type-safe**.
* Introduced in Java 5 to enhance Collections framework.
* Generic types use **angle brackets `<>`** to specify the type parameter.

### Summary:

Generics provide a way to create classes and methods that operate on a specific type specified during instantiation, enhancing type safety and reducing runtime errors. They make Java code more robust and reusable across different types.

### Code Example:

```java
public class Box<T> {
    private T content;
    public void setContent(T content) { this.content = content; }
    public T getContent() { return content; }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Box<String> box = new Box<>();
        box.setContent("Hello Generics");
        System.out.println(box.getContent());
    }
}
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **What are generics in Java?**
   Generics allow classes and methods to operate on specified types, enhancing type safety.

2. **Why were generics introduced?**
   To provide compile-time type checking and avoid runtime ClassCastException.

3. **How do you declare a generic class?**
   By adding a type parameter inside angle brackets, e.g., `class Box<T>`.

---

## 2. Why we need Generics in Java

### Real-time Use Case:

Preventing runtime errors in a retail system storing different product objects in a single collection.

### Explanation:

* Without generics, collections store `Object`, leading to **explicit casting**.
* Casting can cause **ClassCastException** at runtime.
* Generics provide **type safety** during compilation.
* Reduces **boilerplate code** (less casting).
* Enhances **code readability** and maintainability.

### Summary:

Generics are crucial in Java to avoid unsafe casting and potential runtime failures. They enforce type constraints at compile-time, making code safer, cleaner, and easier to maintain.

### Code Example (Without Generics):

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class NoGenerics {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
        list.add("Hello");
        String s = (String) list.get(0);  // Requires casting
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
```

### Code Example (With Generics):

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class WithGenerics {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        String s = list.get(0);  // No casting needed
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **What problem do generics solve?**
   They eliminate the need for explicit casting and reduce runtime errors.

2. **What happens if you don‚Äôt use generics in collections?**
   You must cast objects manually and risk ClassCastException.

3. **Does generics improve code readability? How?**
   Yes, by clearly specifying expected types, making the code easier to understand.

---

## 3. Generic class in Java

### Real-time Use Case:

Creating a reusable container class in an inventory system that can hold any product type.

### Explanation:

* A generic class uses a type parameter `<T>` at the class level.
* The type parameter can be used in fields, methods, and constructors.
* Allows the class to be reusable with different types without rewriting code.
* Can have multiple type parameters: `<T, U>`.
* Type safety is ensured when instantiating the class.

### Summary:

Generic classes are the building blocks for reusable, type-safe components. By specifying type parameters, they prevent casting issues and allow the same class to work with various data types.

### Code Example:

```java
public class Pair<K, V> {
    private K key;
    private V value;

    public Pair(K key, V value) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
    }
    public K getKey() { return key; }
    public V getValue() { return value; }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Pair<String, Integer> pair = new Pair<>("Age", 30);
        System.out.println(pair.getKey() + ": " + pair.getValue());
    }
}
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **What is a generic class?**
   A class with one or more type parameters, allowing for reusable type-safe code.

2. **Can a generic class have multiple type parameters?**
   Yes, e.g., `class Pair<K, V>`.

3. **Where can you use the type parameter inside a generic class?**
   In fields, method return types, parameters, and constructors.

---

## 4. Generics methods in Java

### Real-time Use Case:

Utility methods for converting arrays to lists of any object type in a file processing system.

### Explanation:

* Generic methods define type parameters before the return type.
* Type parameters can be different from the class‚Äôs generic types.
* Used when the method logic is independent of class type parameters.
* Improves **code reuse** across different types.
* Works with static and instance methods.

### Summary:

Generic methods enable type-safe, reusable operations that work with various types regardless of the class‚Äôs generics. They increase flexibility and maintainability in utility and helper methods.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class GenericMethodDemo {

    public static <T> List<T> fromArrayToList(T[] array) {
        List<T> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for (T t : array) {
            list.add(t);
        }
        return list;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer[] intArray = {1, 2, 3};
        List<Integer> intList = fromArrayToList(intArray);
        System.out.println(intList);
    }
}
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **What is a generic method?**
   A method with its own type parameters, independent of the class generics.

2. **Where do you declare the generic type parameter in a method?**
   Before the return type, e.g., `<T> List<T> methodName()`.

3. **Can generic methods be static?**
   Yes, generic methods can be static.

---

## 5. Collections without Generics

### Real-time Use Case:

Legacy code handling user inputs stored in a raw `ArrayList` without generics.

### Explanation:

* Collections without generics store `Object` references.
* Require explicit casting on retrieval.
* Prone to **runtime ClassCastException**.
* Lack of type safety and code readability.
* Common in pre-Java 5 legacy systems.

### Summary:

Collections without generics are risky and verbose due to casting requirements and potential runtime errors. Modern Java encourages the use of generics to avoid these pitfalls.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class RawCollectionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
        list.add("Test");
        String s = (String) list.get(0);  // Unsafe casting
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **What is the drawback of using collections without generics?**
   Unsafe casting and possible runtime exceptions.

2. **Why were raw collections used before Java 5?**
   Because generics were introduced only in Java 5.

3. **How do generics improve raw collections?**
   By adding compile-time type checking and eliminating casting.

---

## 6. Covariance Demo

### Real-time Use Case:

Reading data from a list of animals (e.g., dogs and cats) in a zoo management system without modifying the list.

### Explanation:

* Covariance means using **`? extends T`** wildcard.
* Allows a method to accept a list of `T` or any subtype.
* You **can read** elements safely but **cannot add** new elements except `null`.
* Useful when you want to consume (read) but not modify.
* Provides flexibility in method parameter types.

### Summary:

Covariance with `? extends T` allows safe reading from collections of T or its subclasses. It restricts modifications but increases flexibility for read-only operations.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.List;

public class CovarianceDemo {
    public static void printAnimals(List<? extends Animal> animals) {
        for (Animal a : animals) {
            System.out.println(a.getName());
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Dog> dogs = List.of(new Dog("Buddy"), new Dog("Max"));
        printAnimals(dogs);
    }
}

class Animal {
    private String name;
    public Animal(String name) { this.name = name; }
    public String getName() { return name; }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog(String name) { super(name); }
}
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **What does `? extends T` mean?**
   It allows a wildcard to represent T or any subclass of T.

2. **Can you add elements to a `List<? extends T>`?**
   No, except `null`.

3. **When is covariance useful?**
   When you want to read from a collection without modifying it.

### Explanation:

* Upper bounded wildcard: `<? extends Number>`
* Restricts type to `Number` or subclasses.
* Enables read access safely.
* Cannot add elements (except null).
* Useful for flexible method parameters with subtype restriction.

### Summary:

Upper bounded wildcards restrict types to a specific class and its subclasses, ensuring safe read operations on collections while preventing modifications.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.List;

public class UpperBoundWildcardDemo {
    public static double sumList(List<? extends Number> list) {
        double sum = 0;
        for (Number n : list) {
            sum += n.doubleValue();
        }
        return sum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> integers = List.of(1, 2, 3);
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sumList(integers));
    }
}
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **What does `<? extends Type>` mean?**
   Accepts Type or any subtype of Type.

2. **Can you add elements to a collection with upper bound wildcard?**
   No, you cannot add elements except null.

3. **Why use upper bounded wildcards?**
   To allow flexibility in reading from a range of related types.

---

## 8. Supertype or Lower Bound Wildcards

### Real-time Use Case:

Adding different types of employees (Manager, Engineer) to a list of Person supertype in a HR application.

### Explanation:

* Lower bounded wildcard: `<? super T>`
* Allows passing T or any supertype.
* You **can add** objects of type T or subtype.
* Read operations are limited to Object type.
* Useful when writing to a collection is primary.

### Summary:

Lower bounded wildcards allow adding objects safely to collections while providing flexible input types on the supertype hierarchy, useful in write-heavy contexts.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class LowerBoundWildcardDemo {
    public static void addEmployees(List<? super Manager> list) {
        list.add(new Manager("Alice"));
        list.add(new Engineer("Bob"));  // Subtype of Manager not allowed here
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();
        addEmployees(people);
        System.out.println("Employees added: " + people.size());
    }
}

class Person {
    String name;
    Person(String name) { this.name = name; }
}

class Manager extends Person {
    Manager(String name) { super(name); }
}

class Engineer extends Person {
    Engineer(String name) { super(name); }
}
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **What does `<? super T>` mean?**
   Accepts T or any supertype of T.

Creating a method that can print any type of list without caring about its type parameter.

### Explanation:

* Unbounded wildcard: `<?>`
* Accepts any type.
* Useful for reading only or operations that don‚Äôt depend on type.
* Cannot add elements except null.
* Provides maximum flexibility but limited type information.

### Summary:

Unbounded wildcards allow maximum generality in method parameters or variables, ideal for generic operations like printing or inspecting collections without modifying them.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.List;

public class UnboundedWildcardDemo {
    public static void printList(List<?> list) {
        for (Object obj : list) {
            System.out.println(obj);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> strings = List.of("A", "B", "C");
        List<Integer> integers = List.of(1, 2, 3);

                                          Section 20: Deep dive on Map, HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap

Sure! Here's a detailed breakdown of **Section 20: Deep dive on Map, HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap** with real-time use cases, bullet explanations, summaries, code, and interview Q\&A for each topic.

---

## 1. Introduction to Map in Java

### Real-time Use Case:

Storing user details with user IDs as keys in an e-commerce application for fast lookup.

### Explanation:

* `Map` is an **interface** representing a collection of key-value pairs.
* Keys are **unique**, values can be duplicated.
* Common implementations: `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, `LinkedHashMap`.
* Used when **fast access** to data via keys is needed.
* Supports **null key and values** (depending on implementation).

### Summary:

A `Map` in Java represents a collection that maps unique keys to values, enabling efficient data retrieval. It‚Äôs foundational for scenarios where key-based lookups and fast access to values are essential.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class MapIntro {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Integer, String> userMap = new HashMap<>();
        userMap.put(101, "Alice");
        userMap.put(102, "Bob");
        System.out.println("User 101: " + userMap.get(101));
    }
}
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **What is a Map in Java?**
   It is a collection of key-value pairs with unique keys.

2. **Can a Map have null keys or values?**
   Depends on the implementation; `HashMap` allows one null key.

3. **Name some implementations of Map.**
   `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, and `LinkedHashMap`.

---

## 2. Demo of HashMap

### Real-time Use Case:

Caching session data for users in a web application for quick retrieval.

### Explanation:

* `HashMap` stores data in **key-value pairs**.
* Provides **constant time complexity O(1)** for get/put operations.
* Allows one **null key** and multiple **null values**.
* Not **thread-safe**; use `ConcurrentHashMap` for concurrency.
* Does not maintain any **order** of entries.

### Summary:

`HashMap` is a widely-used implementation of `Map` that offers fast access and storage but does not guarantee order. It‚Äôs ideal for caching and fast lookups where order is not important.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class HashMapDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> productStock = new HashMap<>();
        productStock.put("Laptop", 50);
        productStock.put("Phone", 100);
        System.out.println("Stock for Phone: " + productStock.get("Phone"));
    }
}
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **What is the time complexity of get/put in HashMap?**
   O(1) on average.

2. **Does HashMap maintain insertion order?**
   No.

3. **Can HashMap have null keys?**
   Yes, one null key allowed.

---

## 3. How HashMap Store Key, Value

### Real-time Use Case:

Storing employee details keyed by employee IDs in HR software.

### Explanation:

* Uses an **array of buckets** internally.
* Each bucket holds a **linked list** or **balanced tree** (Java 8+).
* The key‚Äôs `hashCode()` determines the bucket index.
* Collisions handled by chaining or tree structure.
* Improves performance with **balanced trees** when buckets get large.

### Summary:

HashMap stores entries in buckets determined by the hashcode of keys, using linked lists or trees to handle collisions, enabling fast insertion and retrieval even under high collision scenarios.

### Code Example:

```java
// Conceptual, no direct code for storage but this is how it maps
// Hash = key.hashCode()
// index = hash % capacity
// Entry placed in bucket[index]
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **How does HashMap store key-value pairs?**
   In buckets indexed by hashCode of keys.

2. **What happens when two keys have the same hash?**
   Collision is handled by chaining or tree nodes.

3. **What data structure is used inside buckets after Java 8?**
   Balanced trees (Red-Black tree) if many collisions occur.

---

## 4. How HashMap Retrieve Value

### Real-time Use Case:

Fetching product prices in an inventory system quickly by product ID.

### Explanation:

* Computes hash of the key.
* Finds the bucket index.
* Traverses the linked list/tree to find the exact key.
* Uses `equals()` to verify key equality.
* Returns the associated value if key found.

### Summary:

Retrieval in HashMap involves calculating the key‚Äôs hash, locating the appropriate bucket, and searching through entries until a matching key is found, ensuring efficient access.

### Code Example:

```java
HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("Apple", 100);
int price = map.get("Apple");  // Internally calculates hash and searches bucket
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **How does HashMap retrieve a value?**
   By hashing the key and searching the corresponding bucket.

2. **What method checks key equality in HashMap?**
   `equals()` method.

3. **What happens if key not found during retrieval?**
   Returns `null`.

---

## 5. \[JAVA 8] HashMap improvements in Java 8

### Real-time Use Case:

Handling high-collision scenarios in a social media application with many user connections.

### Explanation:

* Introduced **balanced trees (Red-Black trees)** inside buckets after a threshold.
* Reduces worst-case performance from **O(n) to O(log n)**.
* Default capacity and load factor improved for better efficiency.
* Supports **parallelism** better due to reduced collisions.
* Optimizes **memory usage** and lookup time.

### Summary:

Java 8 improved HashMap by converting collision chains to balanced trees, significantly improving worst-case lookup performance, especially in highly-collided buckets.

### Code Example:

No direct code but conceptually, collisions become trees after 8 entries in a bucket.

### Interview Questions:

1. **What major change was made to HashMap in Java 8?**
   Collision chains converted to balanced trees.

2. **Why was this improvement necessary?**
   To prevent performance degradation in high collision cases.

3. **What is the worst-case time complexity after this change?**
   O(log n).

---

## 6. Iterating HashMap using keySet() and entrySet()

### Real-time Use Case:

Listing all customers and their order counts in an order management system.

### Explanation:

* `keySet()` returns a **Set of keys** to iterate keys.
* Use keys to get values via `get()`.
* `entrySet()` returns a **Set of Map.Entry** (key-value pairs).
* `entrySet()` is more efficient for iteration (avoids extra lookups).
* Supports **for-each** and iterator loops.

### Summary:

Iterating using `entrySet()` is more efficient since it directly accesses entries, while `keySet()` requires extra lookup calls. Both provide ways to traverse maps.

### Code Example:

```java
HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("John", 5);
map.put("Jane", 7);

// Using keySet()
for (String key : map.keySet()) {
    System.out.println(key + ": " + map.get(key));
}

// Using entrySet()
for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()) {
    System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
}
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **Which is more efficient for iteration: keySet or entrySet?**
   entrySet.

2. **Why is entrySet more efficient?**
   It avoids extra get() calls by accessing entries directly.

3. **Can you modify map entries while iterating?**
   You can modify values via entrySet but not keys.

---

## 7. Iterating HashMap using values()

### Real-time Use Case:

Summing up total sales from a map of product sales.

### Explanation:

* `values()` returns a **Collection of values**.
* Useful when keys are not needed.
* Can be iterated with enhanced for or iterator.
* Read-only operation on keys.
* Simplifies processing of map values.

### Summary:

`values()` iteration is suitable when only values are needed, simplifying operations like aggregation without dealing with keys.

### Code Example:

```java
HashMap<String, Integer> sales = new HashMap<>();
sales.put("Pen", 100);
sales.put("Notebook", 200);

int total = 0;
for (Integer sale : sales.values()) {
    total += sale;
}
System.out.println("Total sales: " + total);
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **What does values() return?**
   A Collection of map values.

2. **Can you modify keys using values()?**
   No, only values.

3. **When should you use values() iteration?**
   When you only need to process values.

---

## 8. Introduction to TreeMap in Java

### Real-time Use Case:

Maintaining a leaderboard sorted by player scores in a gaming app.

### Explanation:

* Implements `NavigableMap`, a **sorted map** based on keys.
* Keys sorted naturally or by custom comparator.
* Backed by **Red-Black tree**.
* Slower than HashMap (O(log n) get/put).
* Does **not allow null keys**.

### Summary:

HashSet internally uses a HashMap to manage elements, leveraging the map's ability to store unique keys. This mechanism provides constant-time performance for most operations. Understanding this internal structure helps in tuning performance and avoiding common pitfalls like poor hashCode implementations.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class HashSetInternal {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        set.add("Java");
        set.add("Python");
        set.add("Java"); // Duplicate

        System.out.println(set);
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** What internal data structure does HashSet use?
   **A:** HashSet uses a HashMap internally.

2. **Q:** How does HashSet handle collisions?
   **A:** Collisions are handled by storing entries in buckets as linked lists or trees.

* `java.util.Calendar` allows more flexible manipulation like adding/subtracting days, months, etc.
* `java.text.SimpleDateFormat` supports formatting and parsing dates to and from strings.
* Limitations like mutability, thread-safety issues, and poor API design led to improvements in Java 8.

**Summary:**
Java has long supported date and time using classes like `Date` and `Calendar`, allowing representation and manipulation of instants and calendar fields. However, these classes have limitations such as mutability and thread safety problems. Formatting and parsing are handled by `SimpleDateFormat`. The API enables basic date-time operations but has room for improvement, which Java 8 addressed.

**Code Example:**

```java
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.Calendar;

public class DateTimeSupportDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Date now = new Date();
        System.out.println("Current date/time: " + now);

        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
        calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 5);
        System.out.println("Date after 5 days: " + calendar.getTime());
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What is the difference between `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar`?*
   **Answer:** `Date` represents a specific point in time with millisecond precision, whereas `Calendar` is more flexible, allowing field-level operations like adding or subtracting days, months, etc.

2. *Why is `java.util.Date` considered mutable, and why is that a problem?*
   **Answer:** `Date` objects can have their internal time value changed after creation, which can cause unexpected bugs in multi-threaded environments or when used as keys in maps.

3. *How does `SimpleDateFormat` relate to Date in Java?*
   **Answer:** `SimpleDateFormat` formats `Date` objects into strings and parses strings back into `Date` objects, enabling conversion between human-readable formats and machine representation.

### 3. Demo of java.util.Date

**Explanation:**

* `java.util.Date` represents a specific instant in time, measured in milliseconds from the epoch (January 1, 1970).
* It can be created for current time or by passing milliseconds.
* Provides basic methods to get time, but many are deprecated.
* Commonly formatted using `SimpleDateFormat`.
* Mutable, which can lead to issues in multi-threaded apps.

**Summary:**
`java.util.Date` is the basic Java class representing a specific point in time with millisecond precision since the epoch. Though still widely used, many of its methods are deprecated, and it lacks thread safety. It's often formatted using `SimpleDateFormat`. Despite limitations, it's simple for timestamp storage or legacy compatibility.

**Code Example:**

```java
import java.util.Date;

public class UtilDateDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Date now = new Date();
        System.out.println("Current date and time: " + now);

        long millis = System.currentTimeMillis();
        Date fromMillis = new Date(millis);
        System.out.println("Date from milliseconds: " + fromMillis);
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

### 4. Date Formatting and Parsing using SimpleDateFormat

**Explanation:**

* `SimpleDateFormat` is used to format `Date` objects into strings and parse strings into `Date`.
* Supports customizable date/time patterns like "yyyy-MM-dd HH\:mm\:ss".
* Not thread-safe, so instances should not be shared across threads without synchronization.
* Can be used to localize date formats.
* Widely used before Java 8, now replaced by `DateTimeFormatter` in new API.

**Summary:**
`SimpleDateFormat` offers flexible formatting and parsing of `Date` objects via pattern strings. Although powerful, it suffers from thread-safety issues, requiring caution in multi-threaded environments. Its role in Java is now partially supplanted by the newer `DateTimeFormatter`, but it's still common in legacy code.

**Code Example:**

```java
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Date;

public class SimpleDateFormatDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        SimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");
        Date now = new Date();

        String formattedDate = formatter.format(now);
        System.out.println("Formatted date: " + formattedDate);

        Date parsedDate = formatter.parse(formattedDate);
        System.out.println("Parsed date: " + parsedDate);
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *How do you format a Date into a string in Java?*

* Used for database operations, especially with JDBC.
* Truncates time information when converting from `java.util.Date`.
* Provides compatibility between Java and SQL date types.

**Summary:**
`java.sql.Date` focuses on representing SQL DATE values, which contain only the date component without time. It's commonly used when working with databases via JDBC. Although it inherits from `java.util.Date`, it truncates the time fields, making it suitable for date-only columns.

**Code Example:**

```java
import java.sql.Date;

public class SqlDateDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long millis = System.currentTimeMillis();
        Date sqlDate = new Date(millis);

        System.out.println("SQL Date: " + sqlDate);
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. *What is the difference between `java.util.Date` and `java.sql.Date`?*
   **Answer:** `java.sql.Date` only contains date (no time), used for SQL DATE type; `java.util.Date` includes time.

2. *Why is `java.sql.Date` needed?*
   **Answer:** To represent SQL DATE types in JDBC without time components.

3. *How does `java.sql.Date` handle time when created?*

### \[JAVA 8] Introduction to Instant and Duration in java.time Date and Time API

**Use Case:**
You want to measure elapsed time between two events in a high precision manner, such as measuring how long a task takes or tracking timestamps in logs.

**Key Points:**

* `Instant` represents a point on the timeline (timestamp) in UTC.
* `Duration` represents the amount of time between two instants or a span of time.
* `Instant.now()` captures the current moment.
* You can calculate time elapsed between two `Instant` objects using `Duration.between()`.
* `Duration` provides methods to get time in seconds, milliseconds, etc.

**Summary:**
The `Instant` class is perfect for capturing precise timestamps in UTC, while `Duration` is used to represent the time elapsed between two `Instant` objects or an amount of time. This combination is very useful in performance monitoring, timeout implementations, and logging. Unlike legacy date/time APIs, these classes are immutable and thread-safe.

```java
import java.time.Duration;
import java.time.Instant;

public class InstantDurationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Instant start = Instant.now();
        Thread.sleep(2000); // simulate task delay
        Instant end = Instant.now();

        Duration duration = Duration.between(start, end);
        System.out.println("Duration in seconds: " + duration.getSeconds());
        System.out.println("Duration in millis: " + duration.toMillis());
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** What is the difference between `Instant` and `LocalDateTime`?

### \[JAVA 8] Period in java.time Date and Time API

**Use Case:**
Calculate the difference between two dates in terms of years, months, and days, e.g., to find a person‚Äôs age.

**Key Points:**

* `Period` measures time in years, months, and days.
* Used for date-based calculations only (no time or timezone).
* Created via `Period.between(LocalDate start, LocalDate end)`.
* Supports adding or subtracting periods to/from dates.
* Immutable and thread-safe.

**Summary:**
`Period` is ideal for calculating human-readable date differences such as age or tenure. It operates only on `LocalDate` and handles calendar-based differences, which is different from `Duration` which is time-based. This makes `Period` useful in applications dealing with date intervals in business logic.

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.Period;

public class PeriodExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate birthDate = LocalDate.of(1990, 5, 15);
        LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();

        Period age = Period.between(birthDate, today);
        System.out.println("Age is " + age.getYears() + " years, " +
                           age.getMonths() + " months, and " +
                           age.getDays() + " days.");
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** What is the difference between `Period` and `Duration`?
   **A:** `Period` is for date-based time (years, months, days), `Duration` is for time-based amounts (hours, minutes, seconds).

2. **Q:** Can `Period` be negative?
   **A:** Yes, if the start date is after the end date.

3. **Q:** How do you create a `Period` of 2 years and 3 months?
   **A:** `Period.of(2, 3, 0)`.

### \[JAVA 8] The multipliedBy(), dividedBy() & negated() methods

**Use Case:**
You want to scale a duration by a factor (e.g., double or halve a timeout), or invert a duration to represent negative intervals.

**Key Points:**

* `multipliedBy(long)` scales a `Duration` by a factor.
* `dividedBy(long)` divides a `Duration` by a factor.
* `negated()` returns the negative of the `Duration`.
* Useful in arithmetic operations on durations.
* Available only on `Duration`, not `Period`.

**Summary:**
These methods provide easy ways to manipulate durations mathematically. For example, you can double a timeout duration or invert it to represent negative time intervals, which is useful for complex timing or scheduling logic.

```java
import java.time.Duration;

public class DurationMathDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Duration duration = Duration.ofMinutes(10);

        Duration doubleDuration = duration.multipliedBy(2);
        Duration halfDuration = duration.dividedBy(2);
        Duration negativeDuration = duration.negated();

        System.out.println("Original Duration: " + duration);
        System.out.println("Doubled Duration: " + doubleDuration);
        System.out.println("Half Duration: " + halfDuration);
        System.out.println("Negated Duration: " + negativeDuration);
    }
}

* Common units include `ChronoUnit.SECONDS`, `MINUTES`.
* Useful for rounding timestamps or durations.
* Maintains immutability.
* Helps normalize times for comparison or display.

**Summary:**
`truncatedTo()` allows you to simplify timestamps or durations by cutting off precision beyond a specified unit, which is helpful when you want to compare times ignoring finer details or when formatting output for readability.

```java
import java.time.Duration;
import java.time.Instant;
import java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit;

public class TruncatedToExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Instant now = Instant.now();
        Instant truncated = now.truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.SECONDS);

        Duration duration = Duration.ofMillis(12345);
        Duration truncatedDuration = duration.truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.SECONDS);

        System.out.println("Original Instant: " + now);
        System.out.println("Truncated Instant: " + truncated);
        System.out.println("Original Duration: " + duration);
        System.out.println("Truncated Duration: " + truncatedDuration);
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** What does `truncatedTo()` do?
   **A:** It truncates the temporal object to the specified unit, removing smaller units.

2. **Q:** Can you truncate a `LocalDate` with `truncatedTo()`?
   **A:** No, `LocalDate` doesn‚Äôt implement `Temporal` that supports truncation.

3. **Q:** What happens if you truncate to a larger unit than the object precision?
   **A:** It zeroes out smaller units, effectively rounding down.

* Real-time use case with code example
* 5 bullet point explanations
* 5-line summary
* 3 interview questions with answers

---

# 1. Introduction to Functional Programming

### Real-time Use Case

Imagine a logging system that filters log messages based on different criteria (e.g., level, message content). Instead of hardcoding filtering logic, functional programming lets you pass behavior (functions) as parameters, making your code flexible and reusable.

### Explanation

* Functional programming focuses on *what to solve*, not *how to solve*.
* It treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.
* Avoids shared state and mutable data, leading to fewer bugs.
* Supports higher-order functions ‚Äî functions that can accept other functions as parameters or return them.
* Java 8 introduced functional programming features like lambda expressions, streams, and functional interfaces.

### Summary

Functional programming (FP) in Java promotes writing concise, immutable, and side-effect-free code by using functions as first-class citizens. It contrasts with imperative programming by emphasizing *what* needs to be done rather than *how*. Java 8‚Äôs introduction of lambda expressions and streams supports this paradigm, improving readability and maintainability. FP helps reduce bugs by avoiding mutable states and encourages reusability through higher-order functions.

### Code Example

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.function.Predicate;

public class FunctionalProgrammingIntro {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> logs = Arrays.asList("ERROR: Disk not found", "INFO: User logged in", "ERROR: Out of memory");

        // Predicate function to filter error logs
        Predicate<String> errorFilter = log -> log.startsWith("ERROR");

        logs.stream()
            .filter(errorFilter)
            .forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** What is functional programming?
   **A:** Functional programming is a paradigm where computation is treated as the evaluation of mathematical functions, avoiding shared state and mutable data.

2. **Q:** How does functional programming help in reducing bugs?
   **A:** By avoiding mutable states and side effects, it minimizes unpredictable behavior and makes code easier to reason about.

3. **Q:** Name two Java 8 features that support functional programming.
   **A:** Lambda expressions and streams.

# 2. Imperative Style vs Functional Style Programming

### Real-time Use Case

Filtering a list of employee names who are above 30 years old. Imperative style uses loops, functional style uses streams and filters.

### Explanation

* Imperative programming specifies *how* to do things step-by-step (e.g., loops, conditionals).
* Functional programming specifies *what* should be done (e.g., filter, map).
* Imperative code tends to be verbose and stateful.
* Functional code is declarative, concise, and side-effect free.
* Functional style is easier to parallelize and reason about.

### Summary

Imperative programming focuses on explicit instructions and state changes, while functional programming describes the desired result without explicitly coding the control flow. Java 8‚Äôs functional style reduces boilerplate and improves code readability. It makes code less error-prone by eliminating mutable shared states and side effects, which is essential in multi-threaded or complex applications.

### Code Example

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class ImperativeVsFunctional {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> ages = Arrays.asList(25, 30, 35, 40, 28);

        // Imperative style
        List<Integer> resultImperative = new java.util.ArrayList<>();
        for (Integer age : ages) {
            if (age > 30) {
                resultImperative.add(age);
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Imperative: " + resultImperative);

        // Functional style
        List<Integer> resultFunctional = ages.stream()
                                             .filter(age -> age > 30)
                                             .collect(Collectors.toList());
        System.out.println("Functional: " + resultFunctional);
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** What is the main difference between imperative and functional programming?
   **A:** Imperative programming describes *how* to do things step-by-step, while functional programming describes *what* needs to be done declaratively.

2. **Q:** Why is functional programming considered better for parallel execution?
   **A:** Because it avoids mutable shared state and side effects, reducing concurrency issues.

3. **Q:** Can you give a simple example of functional style in Java?
   **A:** Using streams and lambda expressions, e.g., `list.stream().filter(x -> x > 10).collect(Collectors.toList())`.

# 3. What are Lambda Expressions and their Syntax

### Real-time Use Case

You want to pass a piece of code as a parameter to sort a list of strings by length.

### Explanation

* Lambda expressions are anonymous functions ‚Äî functions without names.
* Syntax: `(parameters) -> expression` or `(parameters) -> { statements; }`.
* Used to provide implementation of functional interfaces.
* Enable concise inline implementation of single-method interfaces.
* Improve readability by reducing boilerplate code compared to anonymous inner classes.

### Summary

Lambda expressions in Java 8 provide a clear and concise way to represent anonymous functions. They allow you to pass behavior (functions) as method arguments, making the code more flexible and expressive. Lambdas help reduce verbosity compared to traditional anonymous inner classes, especially for functional interfaces with a single abstract method.

### Code Example

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class LambdaSyntaxExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");

        // Sort by length using lambda expression
        names.sort((s1, s2) -> s1.length() - s2.length());

        names.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** What is a lambda expression in Java?
   **A:** It's an anonymous function that provides implementation of a functional interface using a concise syntax.

2. **Q:** What is the basic syntax of a lambda expression?
   **A:** `(parameters) -> expression` or `(parameters) -> { statements; }`.

3. **Q:** Can lambda expressions access local variables?
   **A:** Yes, but only if they are effectively final (not modified after initialization).

# 4. How to Build Lambda Expressions

### Real-time Use Case

Create a custom Comparator using a lambda to sort employees by salary.

### Explanation

* Identify the target functional interface (e.g., Comparator).
* Determine the method signature (parameters and return type).
* Write the lambda expression matching the method signature.
* Lambda body can be a single expression or block.
* Assign lambda to a functional interface reference or pass inline.

### Summary

Building a lambda expression requires understanding the target functional interface's abstract method signature. By matching parameter types and return type, you can write concise lambda expressions that replace anonymous classes. This leads to more readable and maintainable code, especially for small behavior implementations like comparisons, event handling, or filtering.

### Code Example

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;

public class BuildLambda {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] employees = {"John-5000", "Alice-7000", "Bob-6000"};

        // Comparator lambda to sort by salary
        Comparator<String> bySalary = (e1, e2) -> {
            int salary1 = Integer.parseInt(e1.split("-")[1]);
            int salary2 = Integer.parseInt(e2.split("-")[1]);
            return salary1 - salary2;
        };

        Arrays.sort(employees, bySalary);

        for (String e : employees) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** How do you write a lambda expression for a Comparator?
   **A:** `(param1, param2) -> { /* comparison logic */ }`.

2. **Q:** Can a lambda expression have multiple statements?
   **A:** Yes, use `{ }` to define a block with multiple statements and explicit return if needed.

3. **Q:** What is the relationship between lambda expressions and functional interfaces?
   **A:** Lambdas provide implementations for the single abstract method in functional interfaces.

# 5. Deep Dive on Functional Interfaces

### Real-time Use Case

Use `Predicate` functional interface to filter a list of numbers to only even numbers.

### Explanation

* Functional interfaces have exactly one abstract method.
* Can have default and static methods.
* Annotated optionally with `@FunctionalInterface` for clarity.
* They are the target type for lambda expressions.
* Examples: `Predicate<T>`, `Function<T,R>`, `Consumer<T>`, `Supplier<T>`.

### Summary

Functional interfaces form the foundation of functional programming in Java. Each interface declares a single abstract method, which lambdas implement. This structure enables concise and reusable code constructs that work seamlessly with Java 8's functional features. Java provides several predefined functional interfaces to cover common use cases like filtering, mapping, and consuming values.

### Code Example

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.function.Predicate;

public class FunctionalInterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);

        Predicate<Integer> isEven = n -> n % 2 == 0;

        numbers.stream()
               .filter(isEven)
               .forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** What defines a functional interface in Java?
   **A:** It contains exactly one abstract method.

2. **Q:** What annotation can be used to indicate a functional interface?
   **A:** `@FunctionalInterface`.

3. **Q:** Name some predefined functional interfaces in Java.

# 6. How Functional Interface & Lambda Expressions are Linked

### Real-time Use Case

Passing a lambda to a method expecting a `Runnable` to execute a thread.

### Explanation

* Lambda expressions implement the single abstract method of a functional interface.
* Functional interfaces act as target types for lambdas.
* This linkage allows lambdas to replace anonymous inner classes.
* Compiler infers parameter types from the functional interface.
* Functional interfaces enable polymorphism with lambdas.

### Summary

Lambda expressions and functional interfaces are closely linked; lambdas provide concrete implementations for the single abstract method in functional interfaces. This connection simplifies syntax and enables more readable and maintainable code by replacing verbose anonymous classes. The Java compiler uses the target functional interface to determine lambda parameter types and return types.

### Code Example

```java
public class LambdaAndFunctionalInterface {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Task executed in a thread");

        Thread thread = new Thread(task);
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** How does a lambda expression relate to a functional interface?
   **A:** A lambda provides implementation for the functional interface's single abstract method.

2. **Q:** Can lambdas be used without functional interfaces?
   **A:** No, lambdas must target a functional interface.

3. **Q:** Why do functional interfaces make lambdas possible in Java?
   **A:** They provide a target type with a single abstract method, enabling concise function implementations.

# 7. Anonymous Inner Class in the Place of Lambda Expressions

### Real-time Use Case

Implementing an event listener using anonymous inner class vs lambda expression.

### Explanation

* Anonymous inner classes define and instantiate a class inline.
* Verbose: requires method and class syntax.
* Lambdas are concise replacements for single-method anonymous classes.
* Anonymous inner classes have `this` referencing the inner class, lambdas have `this` of enclosing class.
* Lambdas improve readability and reduce boilerplate.

### Summary

Anonymous inner classes were the original way to implement interfaces inline before Java 8. Lambdas simplify this by providing concise function implementations for functional interfaces. They reduce boilerplate and make the code cleaner while preserving functionality. Understanding differences in `this` keyword behavior between the two is essential.

### Code Example

```java
import javax.swing.JButton;
import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class AnonymousVsLambda {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Button Example");
        JButton button = new JButton("Click Me");

        // Anonymous Inner Class
        button.addActionListener(new java.awt.event.ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent e) {
                System.out.println("Button clicked (anonymous class)");
            }

# 8. Predefined Functional Interfaces Inside JDK

### Real-time Use Case

Use `Function` to convert a list of strings to uppercase.

### Explanation

* Java provides common functional interfaces under `java.util.function`.
* `Predicate<T>` - boolean test.
* `Function<T,R>` - transforms input to output.
* `Consumer<T>` - accepts input, returns nothing.
* `Supplier<T>` - supplies output, takes no input.
* These interfaces enable powerful functional programming idioms.

### Summary

Java 8‚Äôs predefined functional interfaces provide reusable abstractions for common programming tasks, such as filtering, transforming, consuming, and supplying values. They serve as the backbone for lambda expressions and stream operations. By using these interfaces, developers write cleaner, more expressive code without defining custom interfaces for common patterns.

### Code Example

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.function.Function;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class PredefinedFunctionalInterfaces {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("alice", "bob", "charlie");

        Function<String, String> toUpperCase = s -> s.toUpperCase();

        List<String> upperNames = names.stream()
                                       .map(toUpperCase)
                                       .collect(Collectors.toList());

        upperNames.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

* They capture the variable value, not the variable itself.
* Variables can't be reassigned inside lambda if they are captured.
* Helps create closures.
* Enables referencing outer variables inside lambdas safely.

### Real-time Use Case:

Use a variable from an outer scope inside a lambda filtering a list.

### Summary:

Lexical scoping in lambdas means they have access to variables defined in the outer context, but only if those variables are final or effectively final. This allows lambdas to form closures, retaining the captured variable values during execution.

### Code Example:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class LexicalScopingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int threshold = 10; // effectively final
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(5, 15, 20);

        numbers.stream()
               .filter(n -> n > threshold)
               .forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A:

* `super` can be used to call methods of the superclass from the enclosing instance.
* Lambdas don't introduce a new scope for `this`.
* Enables more intuitive access to instance methods and fields.
* Helps avoid boilerplate code compared to inner classes.

### Real-time Use Case:

Use `this` inside a lambda to access the enclosing class's method.

### Summary:

Lambdas use the `this` reference from their surrounding class, making them simpler and more intuitive than anonymous classes, which have their own `this`. The ability to call `super` methods through lambdas enhances flexibility in inheritance scenarios.

### Code Example:

```java
public class ThisSuperLambdaExample {
    public void printMessage() {
        Runnable r = () -> System.out.println(this.getClass().getSimpleName());
        r.run();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new ThisSuperLambdaExample().printMessage();
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A:

                           Section 25: [JAVA 8] Building Lambda expressions using Method References

Sure! Here's a detailed breakdown of **Section 25: \[JAVA 8] Building Lambda Expressions using Method References**, covering each topic with real-time use cases, explanations, summaries, code, and interview questions with answers.

---

## Introduction to Method References

**Real-time Use Case:**
You have a collection of strings and want to print each one using a clean, readable lambda expression. Instead of writing a lambda explicitly, you can use method references to simplify the syntax and improve readability.

### 5 Bullet Point Explanations:

* Method references provide a shorthand notation for lambdas that just call a method.
* They improve code readability and reduce boilerplate.
* There are four types: static method reference, instance method reference, instance method reference using class type, and constructor reference.
* They work only when the method signature matches the functional interface‚Äôs abstract method.
* Commonly used with Stream API operations like `forEach()`, `map()`, `filter()` etc.

### Summary:

Method references are syntactic sugar in Java 8 that allow you to refer directly to existing methods by their names instead of writing full lambda expressions. This leads to concise, clean, and more readable code. It is widely used with functional interfaces and the Stream API, improving maintainability and expressiveness.

```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry");
list.forEach(System.out::println);  // Method reference to print method
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **Q:** What is a method reference in Java 8?
   **A:** A method reference is a shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method directly by name.

2. **Q:** How many types of method references are there?
   **A:** Four ‚Äî static method reference, instance method reference, instance method reference using class type, and constructor reference.

3. **Q:** When can you use method references?
   **A:** When the method signature matches the abstract method of the functional interface being used.

---

## Demo of Static Method Reference

**Real-time Use Case:**
You want to sort a list of integers using a static method like `Integer.compare()`.

### 5 Bullet Point Explanations:

* Static method references point to a static method of a class.
* Used when the method you want to refer to is static.
* Syntax: `ClassName::staticMethodName`.
* Can be used in sorting, comparisons, or any static utility method calls.
* Makes code concise, avoiding explicit lambda parameter passing.

### Summary:

Static method references allow referring to static methods directly, making code simpler when you want to invoke a static method inside a lambda expression. This reduces boilerplate and enhances clarity in functional programming tasks like sorting or comparisons.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(5, 2, 9, 1);
Collections.sort(numbers, Integer::compare);
numbers.forEach(System.out::println);
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **Q:** How do you write a static method reference?
   **A:** Using the syntax `ClassName::staticMethodName`.

2. **Q:** Can static method references be used with instance methods?
   **A:** No, static method references are only for static methods.

3. **Q:** Give an example where static method reference can simplify code.
   **A:** Sorting a list using `Collections.sort(list, Integer::compare)` instead of a lambda.

---

## Demo of Instance Method Reference

**Real-time Use Case:**
You want to convert all strings in a list to uppercase using an instance method of String.

### 5 Bullet Point Explanations:

* Instance method references refer to a method of a particular instance.
* Syntax: `instance::instanceMethodName`.
* Useful when a method call operates on the same instance.
* Makes code simpler when lambda body just calls an instance method.
* Works well with object-level utility or processing methods.

### Summary:

Instance method references simplify the invocation of instance methods on a specific object inside a lambda expression. This approach is perfect when repeatedly calling a method on the same instance, making code concise and readable.

```java
List<String> fruits = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry");
fruits.stream()
      .map(String::toUpperCase)  // Instance method reference on each element
      .forEach(System.out::println);
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **Q:** How is an instance method reference different from a static method reference?
   **A:** Instance method references call methods on an instance, static method references call static methods on a class.

2. **Q:** What is the syntax for an instance method reference?
   **A:** `instance::methodName`.

3. **Q:** Can you use an instance method reference for elements in a collection?
   **A:** Yes, often used with streams to process each element.

---

## Demo of Instance Method Reference Using Class Type

**Real-time Use Case:**
You want to compare two strings in a stream using the instance method `compareTo()` without referencing any specific object.

### 5 Bullet Point Explanations:

* This type uses the class name to refer to an instance method.
* Syntax: `ClassName::instanceMethodName`.
* The first argument passed becomes the instance on which method is invoked.
* The second argument is passed as the parameter to the instance method.
* Commonly used in comparators or predicates where instance method is called on the first parameter.

### Summary:

This method reference form allows you to refer to an instance method via the class name, with the instance being implicitly the first parameter. This is useful in functional interfaces where the method takes the instance as the first argument and another parameter as method input.

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Steve", "Amanda", "John");
Collections.sort(names, String::compareToIgnoreCase);
names.forEach(System.out::println);
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **Q:** What does `ClassName::instanceMethod` mean in method references?
   **A:** It means the instance method will be called on the first parameter passed to the functional interface method.

2. **Q:** How does the first parameter relate to the instance in this method reference?
   **A:** The first parameter is treated as the instance on which the method is called.

3. **Q:** Can you use this type of method reference with BiFunction or Comparator?
   **A:** Yes, very commonly used with Comparator and BiFunction.

---

## Demo of Constructor Reference

**Real-time Use Case:**
You want to create new objects inside a stream, e.g., create `Person` objects from a list of names.

### 5 Bullet Point Explanations:

* Constructor references refer to a class constructor.
* Syntax: `ClassName::new`.
* Used when a lambda expression creates a new instance.
* Matches functional interfaces like `Supplier`, `Function`, or `BiFunction`.
* Improves readability when mapping data to objects.

### Summary:

Constructor references simplify object creation in lambda expressions by referencing constructors directly. This provides a clear and concise way to instantiate new objects, especially useful in stream transformations or factories.

```java
class Person {
    String name;
    Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
List<Person> people = names.stream()
                           .map(Person::new)  // Constructor reference
                           .collect(Collectors.toList());
people.forEach(p -> System.out.println(p.getName()));
```

### Interview Questions:

1. **Q:** What is a constructor reference in Java 8?
   **A:** A shorthand notation for creating new objects by referring to constructors.

**Use case:** Understanding that streams operate on the source but do not store elements.

* Streams do not hold data internally.
* They are simply views or pipelines over the data source.
* Operations on streams produce new streams without changing source.
* Because no storage, streams are lightweight and memory efficient.
* Avoid side effects by not modifying the original collection.

**Summary:**
Streams do not store data; they work as a pipeline of operations on data sources like collections. This ensures immutability and efficiency. Each intermediate operation returns a new Stream, leaving the original data intact. This design enables functional programming principles in Java, promoting safer and cleaner code.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class StreamNoStorage {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> items = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry");
        // Stream created but no storage, operations are lazy
        items.stream()
             .filter(s -> s.startsWith("a"))
             .forEach(System.out::println);  // Outputs: apple
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** Do Streams store data?
   **A:** No, streams don‚Äôt store data; they process data from a source.

2. **Q:** Why is it important that streams have no storage?

## 4. Introduction to Streams Pipeline

**Use case:** Chain multiple operations on a Stream in a pipeline for data processing.

* Streams pipeline consists of source, intermediate operations, and terminal operation.
* Intermediate operations are lazy; terminal operation triggers execution.
* Examples: map, filter, sorted (intermediate), forEach, collect (terminal).
* Pipelines allow chaining multiple operations concisely.
* Improves readability and performance with lazy evaluation.

**Summary:**
Streams pipelines allow chaining multiple operations into a single expressive flow. The source is a data provider (like a collection), intermediate operations transform the data lazily, and terminal operations trigger processing. This model leads to clean, efficient, and readable code for complex data manipulations.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class StreamPipeline {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> fruits = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry", "avocado");
        fruits.stream()
              .filter(f -> f.startsWith("a"))
              .map(String::toUpperCase)
              .forEach(System.out::println);  // Outputs: APPLE, AVOCADO
    }
}
```

* Intermediate operation; lazy evaluation.

**Summary:**
The `map()` method applies a transformation function to each element, creating a new stream of modified elements. It‚Äôs commonly used for conversions or computations on elements without changing the original data source. This makes data transformation intuitive and clean.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class StreamMapDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("john", "jane", "jack");
        names.stream()
             .map(String::toUpperCase)
             .forEach(System.out::println);  // Outputs: JOHN, JANE, JACK
    }
}
```

* Helps avoid nested streams or loops.
* Combines multiple lists into one stream.
* Intermediate operation; lazy.

**Summary:**
The `flatMap()` method is used to flatten nested structures like collections within collections into a single stream. It‚Äôs very useful when dealing with streams of collections or optional values, allowing you to write concise, flat pipelines instead of nested loops or streams.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class StreamFlatMapDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<List<String>> nestedList = Arrays.asList(
            Arrays.asList("a", "b"),

## 7. Demo of Streams filter() method

**Use case:** Select elements matching a condition, e.g., filter even numbers.

* `filter()` accepts a predicate to select elements.
* Removes elements not matching the predicate.
* Used for conditional data processing.
* Intermediate operation; lazy.
* Useful for cleaning or selecting data subsets.

**Summary:**
The `filter()` method is used to include only elements that satisfy a given condition. It‚Äôs a fundamental operation for extracting relevant data from streams. This allows concise expression of filtering logic in pipelines without explicit loops or conditional statements.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

3. **Q:** Is filter() an intermediate or terminal operation?
   **A:** Intermediate operation.

---

## 8. Demo of Streams limit() method

**Use case:** Restrict the number of elements processed, e.g., top 3 results.

* `limit(n)` truncates the stream to contain at most n elements.
* Useful for pagination, sampling, or restricting output size.
* Intermediate operation.
* Works well with sorted streams.
* Can optimize performance by reducing processing.

**Summary:**
The `limit()` method restricts the stream size to a maximum count. It‚Äôs useful when you need to limit results, such as top-N queries or sampling. This helps improve performance by preventing unnecessary processing of the entire data set.

```java
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class StreamLimitDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IntStream.range(1, 10)
                 .limit(3)
                 .forEach(System.out::println);  // Outputs: 1, 2, 3
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

* `skip(n)` skips first n elements and returns the rest.
* Useful for pagination or ignoring initial data.
* Intermediate operation.
* Can be combined with limit for offset + fetch logic.
* Works efficiently on ordered streams.

**Summary:**
The `skip()` method omits the first N elements from a stream and processes the rest. It‚Äôs handy for implementing paging by skipping over data already displayed. Combining `skip()` with `limit()` enables precise control over data subsets in streams.

```java
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class StreamSkipDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IntStream.range(1, 10)
                 .skip(5)

## 10. Streams are traversable only once

**Use case:** Understanding that streams cannot be reused after terminal operation.

* Streams can be consumed only once.
* After terminal operation, stream is closed.
* Attempting to reuse causes IllegalStateException.
* To reuse, recreate the stream from the source.
* Important for designing stream-based workflows.

**Summary:**
Streams in Java are single-use sequences. Once a terminal operation is invoked, the stream is closed and cannot be reused or re-traversed. This ensures efficient resource use but requires careful design when multiple passes over data are needed. Always create a new stream to reprocess data.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class StreamOnceDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> data = Arrays.asList("x", "y", "z");
        var stream = data.stream();

        stream.forEach(System.out::println);
        // Uncommenting below line throws IllegalStateException
        // stream.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** Can you reuse a stream after a terminal operation?
   **A:** No, streams can be traversed only once.

2. **Q:** What exception is thrown if you reuse a stream?
   **A:** IllegalStateException.

3. **Q:** How do you process the same data multiple times with streams?
   **A:** By creating a new stream from the source each time.

## 1. Introduction to Streams reduce() method

**Use case:** Aggregate stream elements into a single value, like sum, product, or concatenation.

* `reduce()` performs a reduction on stream elements using an associative accumulation function.
* It takes either one, two, or three arguments depending on the overload.
* Often used for summing numbers, concatenating strings, or combining objects.
* Returns an `Optional` if no identity is provided, otherwise returns the reduced value.
* Supports parallel execution efficiently if the function is associative.

**Summary:**
The `reduce()` method reduces the entire stream into a single value by repeatedly combining elements using a provided function. It is useful for calculations like summing, multiplying, or merging data. Reduction is done using an accumulator and optionally an identity value. It‚Äôs a terminal operation and supports parallel processing efficiently if the accumulator function is associative and stateless.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Optional;

public class StreamReduceIntro {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

        // Sum using reduce with identity
        int sum = Arrays.stream(numbers)
                        .reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b);
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);  // Outputs: Sum: 15

        // Product using reduce without identity (returns Optional)
        Optional<Integer> product = Arrays.stream(numbers)
                                          .reduce((a, b) -> a * b);
        product.ifPresent(p -> System.out.println("Product: " + p));  // Outputs: Product: 120
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** What is the purpose of the reduce() method?
   **A:** To combine stream elements into a single result by repeatedly applying an accumulator function.

2. **Q:** What happens if you use reduce() without an identity?
   **A:** It returns an Optional because the stream might be empty.

3. **Q:** What requirements must the accumulator function in reduce() satisfy?
   **A:** It must be associative and stateless for correct parallel execution.

                                            .reduce((w1, w2) -> w1.length() > w2.length() ? w1 : w2);
        longestWord.ifPresent(w -> System.out.println("Longest word: " + w));  // Outputs: Longest word: banana
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** Can reduce() be used for non-numeric operations?
   **A:** Yes, reduce() works with any data type and a suitable accumulator.

2. **Q:** What does reduce() return if the stream is empty and no identity is provided?
   **A:** It returns an empty Optional.

3. **Q:** Is reduce() a terminal or intermediate operation?
   **A:** It is a terminal operation.

* Useful for wrapping results (e.g., making collections immutable).
* Helps post-process collection results before returning.
* Allows chaining of collection and transformation in one step.
* Terminal operation used in complex collecting scenarios.

**Summary:**
`collectingAndThen()` is a handy collector wrapper that applies a finishing step after collection. For instance, it can collect a stream into a list and then return an unmodifiable version. This improves safety and immutability of results while keeping code concise.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class CollectingAndThenDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> items = Arrays.asList("one", "two", "three");

        List<String> unmodifiable = items.stream()
                                         .filter(s -> s.length() > 2)
                                         .collect(Collectors.collectingAndThen(
                                            Collectors.toList(),
                                            Collections::unmodifiableList));

        System.out.println(unmodifiable);  // Outputs: [three]
        // unmodifiable.add("four");  // Throws UnsupportedOperationException
    }
}
```

            .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(s -> s.charAt(0)));
        System.out.println("Grouped by first letter: " + grouped);

        // Partition by length > 5
        Map<Boolean, List<String>> partitioned = words.stream()
            .collect(Collectors.partitioningBy(s -> s.length() > 5));
        System.out.println("Partitioned by length > 5: " + partitioned);
    }
}
```

* Ordering and statefulness of operations affect performance and behavior.

**Summary:**
Streams pipelines represent a chain of operations that transform data from a source to a final result. Intermediate operations are lazy, enabling optimizations and efficient processing. Terminal operations finalize the pipeline. Understanding pipeline behavior helps write efficient, clean stream-based code.

```java
// Already shown in previous examples (stream pipeline)
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** What triggers execution in a stream pipeline?
   **A:** The terminal operation.

2. **Q:** Are intermediate operations executed immediately?
   **A:** No, they are lazy.

3. **Q:** Can streams be parallel?
   **A:** Yes, by using parallelStream() or stream().parallel().

## 8. Deep dive on parallel streams and demo

**Use case:** Improve performance by processing streams concurrently on multiple cores.

* Parallel streams split data into chunks processed in parallel.
* Use ForkJoinPool under the hood.
* Suitable for CPU-intensive, stateless, associative operations.
* Avoid side effects and shared mutable state in parallel streams.
* May not always improve performance (overhead costs).

**Summary:**
Parallel streams leverage multi-core architectures to speed up data processing. By dividing tasks, they perform operations concurrently. They require careful use of stateless, associative functions and thread-safe practices. When used correctly, parallel streams provide significant performance gains in large datasets.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class ParallelStreamDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);

        int sum = numbers.parallelStream()
                         .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)
                         .sum();
        System.out.println("Sum using parallel stream: " + sum);
    }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** How do you create a parallel stream?
   **A:** By calling `.parallelStream()` on a collection or `.parallel()` on an existing stream.

2. **Q:** What type of operations are suitable for parallel streams?
   **A:** Stateless, associative, and side-effect-free operations.

3. **Q:** Can parallel streams lead to inconsistent results?
   **A:** Yes, if operations have side effects or are not thread-safe.

---

## 9. Collections Vs Streams

**Use case:** Knowing when to use collections or streams.

* Collections are in-memory data structures storing elements.
* Streams represent computations on data, do not store elements.
* Collections support random access, indexing; streams support pipeline processing.
* Streams can be sequential or parallel; collections do not handle concurrency.
* Streams are more suitable for bulk operations, collections for storage and manipulation.

**Summary:**
Collections are concrete data holders, whereas streams are abstract sequences of elements supporting functional-style operations. Collections provide storage, random access, and manipulation. Streams enable declarative processing, lazy evaluation, and parallelism. Choosing between them depends on whether you want to store data or process it efficiently.

```java
// Collections usage
List<String> list = List.of("a", "b", "c");

// Stream usage
list.stream().filter(s -> s.equals("a")).forEach(System.out::println);
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** Does a Stream store data?
   **A:** No, streams do not store data; collections do.

2. **Q:** Can you modify a collection while processing a stream from it?
   **A:** It can cause ConcurrentModificationException.

3. **Q:** When should you prefer streams over collections?

## ‚úÖ Introduction to Optional class

### üßë‚Äçüíº Real-time Use Case:

In a user management system, instead of returning `null` when a user is not found by ID, return an `Optional<User>` to avoid `NullPointerException`.

### üîç Key Points:

* `Optional` is a container object which may or may not contain a non-null value.
* Introduced in Java 8 to handle null checks in a more functional and safe way.
* Helps eliminate `NullPointerException` by enforcing explicit null handling.
* Promotes clean, readable, and intention-revealing code.
* Often used as return type from repository or service methods.

### üìù Summary:

The `Optional` class in Java 8 provides a clean way to represent the presence or absence of a value. It is widely used in modern Java development to avoid `null` checks. `Optional` encapsulates the idea that a return value might be empty. This leads to more expressive and safer APIs. It is most useful in return types of methods, especially in repositories.

### üíª Code:

```java
import java.util.Optional;

public class OptionalIntro {
    public static Optional<String> getUserEmail(boolean exists) {
        if (exists) {
            return Optional.of("user@example.com");
        } else {
            return Optional.empty();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Optional<String> email = getUserEmail(false);
        System.out.println(email); // Output: Optional.empty
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Questions:

1. **Q:** Why was `Optional` introduced in Java 8?
   **A:** To handle `null` more gracefully and avoid `NullPointerException` by explicitly dealing with absent values.

2. **Q:** Can `Optional` be used as a method parameter?
   **A:** It's not recommended; use it for return types to indicate a possible absence of a value.

3. **Q:** What's the difference between `Optional.empty()` and `null`?
   **A:** `Optional.empty()` is an intentional absence of value with methods to handle it safely, while `null` can cause exceptions.

## ‚úÖ Demo of Optional

### üßë‚Äçüíº Real-time Use Case:

Getting customer address data from a service that might return `null`.

### üîç Key Points:

* `Optional.of(value)` creates an `Optional` with a non-null value.
* `Optional.ofNullable(value)` can take a null and return an empty Optional.
* `Optional.empty()` creates an empty Optional.
* Helps avoid `if(value != null)` checks.
* Encourages safe handling via Optional API.

### üìù Summary:

This demo illustrates the construction of `Optional` using various factory methods. It helps represent different scenarios like definite value, potential nulls, or completely empty states. Developers are encouraged to avoid using `null` directly and instead wrap possible-null values in `Optional`. This promotes better design and avoids runtime issues.

### üíª Code:

```java
public class OptionalDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Optional<String> nonEmpty = Optional.of("John");
        Optional<String> nullable = Optional.ofNullable(null);
        Optional<String> empty = Optional.empty();

        System.out.println(nonEmpty);  // Optional[John]
        System.out.println(nullable);  // Optional.empty
        System.out.println(empty);     // Optional.empty
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Questions:

1. **Q:** What's the difference between `Optional.of()` and `Optional.ofNullable()`?
   **A:** `of()` throws `NullPointerException` if value is null, while `ofNullable()` safely returns empty Optional.

2. **Q:** Can Optional hold `null`?
   **A:** No, Optional is designed to avoid holding null values directly.

3. **Q:** What happens if you pass `null` to `Optional.of()`?
   **A:** It throws a `NullPointerException`.

## ‚úÖ Demo of ifPresent, ifPresentOrElse, orElse, orElseGet methods

### üßë‚Äçüíº Real-time Use Case:

Display a user‚Äôs phone number if present, otherwise show a default message.

### üîç Key Points:

* `ifPresent()` executes code if value is present.
* `ifPresentOrElse()` adds an else condition for empty case.
* `orElse()` returns a default value if empty.
* `orElseGet()` takes a Supplier for default value (lazy execution).
* Encourages functional-style handling of optional values.

### üìù Summary:

Optional provides powerful methods for conditionally accessing values. `ifPresent()` is useful for executing logic only when the value is present. `orElse()` and `orElseGet()` are fallback mechanisms. `orElseGet()` is more efficient as it defers execution. These methods simplify handling optional values without verbose null checks.

### üíª Code:

```java
public class OptionalActions {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Optional<String> name = Optional.ofNullable("Alice");

        name.ifPresent(System.out::println); // prints "Alice"

        name.ifPresentOrElse(
            val -> System.out.println("Name: " + val),
            () -> System.out.println("No name")
        );

        System.out.println(name.orElse("Default"));       // Alice
        System.out.println(name.orElseGet(() -> "Lazy")); // Alice
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Questions:

1. **Q:** When to use `orElse()` vs `orElseGet()`?
   **A:** Use `orElseGet()` if default value creation is expensive or needs lazy evaluation.

2. **Q:** How does `ifPresentOrElse()` improve code clarity?
   **A:** It cleanly handles both present and absent cases in one method call.

3. **Q:** Is `ifPresent()` a replacement for null checks?
   **A:** Yes, it executes code only if value is present, avoiding manual null checks.

## ‚úÖ Demo of orElseThrow, map, filter methods

### üßë‚Äçüíº Real-time Use Case:

Processing a user-provided discount code if it‚Äôs valid, otherwise throw exception.

### üîç Key Points:

* `orElseThrow()` throws exception if value is not present.
* `map()` transforms the value if present.
* `filter()` filters the value based on a condition.
* Can chain methods to build pipelines.
* Promotes safe transformation and validation of data.

### üìù Summary:

These `Optional` methods enhance safe data processing. `orElseThrow()` is useful when a missing value is exceptional. `map()` lets you transform the value elegantly. `filter()` provides conditional checks without null safety concerns. Together, they form a fluent API for data pipelines. It leads to concise, functional code.

### üíª Code:

```java
public class OptionalAdvanced {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Optional<String> coupon = Optional.of("DISCOUNT20");

        String upper = coupon.map(String::toUpperCase)
                             .filter(code -> code.startsWith("DISCOUNT"))
                             .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Invalid code"));

        System.out.println("Valid Coupon: " + upper);
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Questions:

1. **Q:** What does `orElseThrow()` do?
   **A:** It throws a provided exception if the Optional is empty.

2. **Q:** How does `map()` work with Optional?
   **A:** It transforms the value inside the Optional if present.

3. **Q:** Can `filter()` be used for validation?
   **A:** Yes, it allows retaining values that satisfy a predicate.

## ‚úÖ Quick tip to filter null elements with Stream API

### üßë‚Äçüíº Real-time Use Case:

Filter out null product names from a list before displaying in UI.

### üîç Key Points:

* Streams can contain null elements if list is not clean.
* Use `filter(Objects::nonNull)` to remove them.
* Prevents `NullPointerException` in later operations.
* Enhances robustness and cleanliness of code.
* Combines well with `map()` and `collect()`.

### üìù Summary:

When processing collections, null elements can silently break stream operations. A simple use of `filter(Objects::nonNull)` ensures that only valid, non-null items are processed. This practice avoids errors and results in cleaner data handling. Especially important when working with external inputs or legacy systems. This is a quick and effective hygiene tip for production code.

### üíª Code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Objects;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class NullFilter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", null, "Bob", null, "Charlie");

        List<String> validNames = names.stream()
                                       .filter(Objects::nonNull)
                                       .collect(Collectors.toList());

        System.out.println(validNames); // [Alice, Bob, Charlie]
    }
}
```

### ‚ùì Interview Questions:

1. **Q:** Why filter nulls in Stream API?
   **A:** To avoid runtime errors and ensure safe downstream operations.

2. **Q:** What does `Objects::nonNull` do?
   **A:** It's a method reference to filter out null values from a stream.

3. **Q:** Can streams process nulls directly?


**A:** Streams can contain nulls, but operations like `map()` may fail if nulls aren't handled.

---

## ‚úÖ What is MultiThreading?

### üß† Explanation with Real-Time Use Case:

Multithreading is a programming feature that allows **multiple threads to run concurrently** within a single process, sharing the same memory space.

**Real-Time Use Case:**
In a web server, multiple threads handle different client requests simultaneously. One thread can process a user login while another handles a data fetch operation.

### üîç 5 Bullet Points:

* Multithreading enables concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program.
* Threads share the same process memory space.
* It's useful in applications requiring responsiveness (e.g., UI applications).
* Improves resource utilization and system throughput.
* Threads can run independently but share state and data.

### üìù Summary:

Multithreading allows multiple sequences of programmed instructions to run concurrently within the same application. This enhances performance, especially in I/O-bound and CPU-bound operations. It's widely used in real-time applications like servers, games, and multimedia platforms. Using threads, we can keep the UI responsive or speed up background tasks. Java provides built-in support for multithreading via the `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface.

### üíª Code Example:

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

### üéØ Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** What is multithreading in Java?
   **A:** It‚Äôs the concurrent execution of two or more threads to maximize CPU utilization.

2. **Q:** How does Java implement multithreading?

## ‚úÖ How a Program or Software Executes Inside a Computer

### üß† Real-Time Use Case:

When you open Chrome, your OS loads the application into memory, allocates CPU cycles, and spawns multiple threads to handle rendering, input, and networking.

### üîç 5 Bullet Points:

* A program is first compiled into bytecode or machine code.
* The OS loads the executable into memory and assigns a process.
* Each process has its own memory space and system resources.
* The CPU executes instructions from the main thread or multiple threads.
* Thread scheduling is managed by the OS and Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

### üìù Summary:

Software execution involves loading the program into memory, allocating CPU resources, and running it as a process. Each process may spawn multiple threads to optimize performance and responsiveness. The JVM plays a key role in managing bytecode execution and threads in Java applications. The OS's scheduler determines the execution sequence and time slices for threads.

### üíª Code Example:

```java
public class ExecutionModel {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main program started by thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
```

### üéØ Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** How does a Java program execute inside a computer?
   **A:** The JVM loads bytecode, creates a main thread, and runs the `main()` method.

2. **Q:** What role does the OS play in execution?
   **A:** It allocates resources, schedules threads, and manages memory.

3. **Q:** What is the JVM?
   **A:** Java Virtual Machine that interprets Java bytecode and manages thread execution.

## ‚úÖ Parallel vs Concurrent Execution

### üß† Real-Time Use Case:

In a video editor, parallel processing might encode multiple videos at the same time, while concurrent processing might alternate tasks like loading UI, rendering video, and playing audio.

### üîç 5 Bullet Points:

* **Parallel Execution**: Tasks run *at the same time* on multiple processors or cores.
* **Concurrent Execution**: Tasks appear to run simultaneously but may be interleaved.
* Parallelism improves performance in CPU-bound applications.
* Concurrency is more about structure; parallelism is about execution.
* Java supports both via threads and executors.

### üìù Summary:

Parallelism and concurrency both deal with multitasking, but they differ in execution. Concurrency manages multiple tasks by interleaving them on a single core, while parallelism executes them truly simultaneously on multiple cores. Java offers constructs to achieve both using the `Thread` class or the `ExecutorService`. Understanding the distinction is critical for designing efficient applications.

### üíª Code Example:

```java
class ConcurrentTask implements Runnable {
    private String task;

    ConcurrentTask(String task) {
        this.task = task;
    }

    public void run() {
        System.out.println(task + " running on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Thread(new ConcurrentTask("Task1")).start();
        new Thread(new ConcurrentTask("Task2")).start();
    }
}
```

### üéØ Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** What is the difference between parallel and concurrent execution?
   **A:** Parallel = simultaneous execution, Concurrent = interleaved execution.

2. **Q:** Can concurrency be achieved on a single core?
   **A:** Yes, by time-slicing tasks.

3. **Q:** Which Java classes support parallel execution?
   **A:** `ForkJoinPool`, `Executors`, and thread classes.

## ‚úÖ How Multiple Threads Improve Performance

### üß† Real-Time Use Case:

In a banking app, multiple threads handle balance checks, withdrawals, and fund transfers concurrently, improving speed and responsiveness.

### üîç 5 Bullet Points:

* Threads allow splitting tasks into smaller, concurrent subtasks.
* Utilizes idle CPU time effectively.
* Reduces response time for I/O operations.
* Improves scalability in server applications.
* Background tasks (logging, monitoring) run without blocking main thread.

### üìù Summary:

Using multiple threads can drastically improve application performance by leveraging CPU cores efficiently. While one thread waits (e.g., for I/O), another can execute. This parallelism leads to faster execution, better responsiveness, and higher throughput in multi-core systems. Java provides robust thread management APIs to facilitate these benefits.

### üíª Code Example:

```java
class Task extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            System.out.println("Task running: " + i + " on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Task().start();
        new Task().start();
    }
}
```

### üéØ Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** How do multiple threads improve performance?
   **A:** By utilizing CPU cores concurrently and handling I/O asynchronously.

2. **Q:** Are threads useful in single-core systems?
   **A:** Yes, via time-slicing and improved responsiveness.

3. **Q:** When can multithreading hurt performance?
   **A:** In CPU-bound tasks with excessive context switching or shared resource contention.

## ‚úÖ Creating Threads in Java

### üß† Real-Time Use Case:

In a download manager, each file download can be handled by a separate thread, allowing multiple downloads simultaneously.

### üîç 5 Bullet Points:

* Java threads can be created by extending `Thread` or implementing `Runnable`.
* `start()` method is used to begin execution.
* Threads can run independently.
* Main thread and custom threads can coexist.
* `Runnable` is preferred for better OOP design and thread pooling.

### üìù Summary:

Java provides two primary ways to create threads: by extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface. The `Runnable` approach is more flexible and preferred for larger applications. After creating the thread, `start()` triggers execution in a new call stack. This design pattern enables concurrent and scalable processing.

### üíª Code Example:

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t1.start();
    }
}
```

### üéØ Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** How can we create a thread in Java?
   **A:** By extending `Thread` or implementing `Runnable`.

2. **Q:** Which is preferred: `Thread` or `Runnable`?
   **A:** `Runnable` is preferred for better separation of task and thread logic.

3. **Q:** What does `start()` do?
   **A:** It starts a new thread and calls the `run()` method asynchronously.

---

## ‚úÖ MultiThreading Demo Program

### üß† Real-Time Use Case:

Running background data sync while allowing users to interact with a UI concurrently.

### üîç 5 Bullet Points:

* Demonstrates concurrent task execution.
* Shows thread independence.
* Highlights the use of `start()` vs `run()`.
* Useful for simulation of real-world tasks.
* Displays thread names and timing.

### üìù Summary:

A multithreading demo illustrates how Java manages concurrent tasks using threads. It differentiates between calling `run()` directly (no threading) vs using `start()` (true multithreading). Such demos help visualize parallel flows and thread behaviors. They're


useful for debugging and understanding thread lifecycle.

### üíª Code Example:

```java
class DemoThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running in thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DemoThread t1 = new DemoThread();
        DemoThread t2 = new DemoThread();
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

### üéØ Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** What‚Äôs the difference between `start()` and `run()`?
   **A:** `start()` creates a new thread; `run()` executes in the current thread.

2. **Q:** Can we start the same thread twice?
   **A:** No, it will throw `IllegalThreadStateException`.

3. **Q:** What happens if we don‚Äôt call `start()`?
   **A:** The `run()` method executes like a normal method.

## ‚úÖ Demo of Thread Methods: `getId`, `getName`, `setName`, `currentThread`, `sleep`

### üß† Real-Time Use Case:

Tracking and debugging thread execution in a server handling multiple user requests.

### üîç 5 Bullet Points:

* `getId()` retrieves the thread's unique ID.
* `getName()` and `setName()` are used for labeling threads.
* `currentThread()` returns a reference to the currently executing thread.
* `sleep(ms)` pauses thread execution for specified milliseconds.
* Useful for logging and timing control in concurrent applications.

### üìù Summary:

Java provides various utility methods in the `Thread` class for managing thread identity and behavior. `getName()` and `setName()` help with logging. `getId()` helps in uniquely identifying threads. `sleep()` allows controlled delays in thread execution. These methods make debugging and scheduling easier in concurrent applications.

### üíª Code Example:

```java
public class ThreadMethodsDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Thread ID: " + Thread.currentThread().getId());
            System.out.println("Thread Name: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
                System.out.println("After sleep: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });

        t.setName("WorkerThread");
        t.start();
    }
}
```

### üéØ Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q:** What does `currentThread()` return?
   **A:** A reference to the currently executing thread.

2. **Q:** What is the use of `sleep()` in threads?
   **A:** To pause the thread for a specified time.

3. **Q:** How can we uniquely identify a thread?
   **A:** Using the `getId()` method.

## 1. **Thread.join(), getPriority(), setPriority()**

**Use case:** Waiting for a background task to finish before proceeding.

**Code example:**

```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Working‚Ä¶");
});
t.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
System.out.println("Main sees priority: " + t.getPriority());
t.start();
t.join();
System.out.println("Worker finished");
```

**üîç 5 Bullet‚Äëpoint explanations:**

* `setPriority(...)` assigns a scheduling priority (1‚Äì10).
* `getPriority()` reads the current priority setting.
* `start()` kicks off thread execution.
* `join()` blocks current thread until `t` completes.
* Ensures sequencing: main doesn't proceed until worker done.

**üìù 5‚Äëline summary + code:**
This demo sets a thread to highest priority, starts it, and the main thread waits for it to finish using `join()`. `getPriority()` validates the set value. The blocking call to `join()` ensures ordered execution.

```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Done work"));
t.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
System.out.println("Priority is " + t.getPriority());
t.start();
t.join();
```

**üé§ Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* What happens if you call `join(1000)`?
   *A:* The calling thread waits up to 1 second; then proceeds even if target thread is still running.
2. *Q:* Does `setPriority()` guarantee execution order?
   *A:* No‚Äîpriority is a hint; scheduling is OS/JVM dependent.
3. *Q:* Can `join()` be interrupted?
   *A:* Yes‚Äî`join()` throws `InterruptedException` if the thread is interrupted while waiting.

---

## 2. **wait(), notify(), notifyAll()**

**Use case:** Two threads coordinate via queue item availability.

**Code example:**

```java
Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
Object lock = new Object();

Thread producer = new Thread(() -> {
  synchronized(lock) {
    q.add(42);
    lock.notify();
  }
});
Thread consumer = new Thread(() -> {
  synchronized(lock) {
    while (q.isEmpty()) lock.wait();
    System.out.println(q.poll());
  }
});
consumer.start(); producer.start();
```

**üîç 5 Bullet‚Äëpoints:**

* `wait()` releases lock and blocks current thread.
* `notify()` wakes one waiter on same lock.
* `notifyAll()` wakes all waiting threads.
* Must call within synchronized block on common monitor.
* Classic producer/consumer pattern.

**üìù 5‚Äëline summary + code:**
Consumer waits until an item is added; producer signals via `notify()`. Both use the same monitor and `wait()`/`notify()` only inside the `synchronized` block.

```java
synchronized(lock) {
  while(q.isEmpty()) lock.wait();
  System.out.println(q.poll());
}
```

**üé§ Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* What‚Äôs the difference between `notify()` and `notifyAll()`?
   *A:* `notify()` wakes one thread; `notifyAll()` wakes all waiting threads.
2. *Q:* Why use `while(...) wait()` not `if(...) wait()`?
   *A:* To re-check the condition after being notified (spurious wakeups).
3. *Q:* Do you need to re-acquire the lock after `wait()`?
   *A:* Yes, upon wake-up, the thread reacquires the monitor before continuing.

---

## 3. **Race condition & synchronized keyword**

**Use case:** Two threads updating shared counter.

**Code example:**

```java
class Counter {
  int c = 0;
  synchronized void inc() { c++; }
}
```

**üîç 5 Bullet‚Äëpoints:**

* A race occurs when multiple threads update shared data unsafely.
* `c++` isn‚Äôt atomic ‚Äì read-modify-write can interleave.
* `synchronized` enforces mutual exclusion.
* It uses a monitor (object lock) to coordinate threads.
* Prevents inconsistent state in concurrent updates.

**üìù 5‚Äëline summary + code:**
Unprotected shared updates cause unpredictable values due to race. Declaring `inc()` synchronized serializes access, ensuring correct counter increments between threads.

```java
class Counter {
  int c = 0;
  synchronized void inc() { c++; }
}
```

**üé§ Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* What's a race condition?
   *A:* A bug where timing/order of thread execution causes wrong behavior.
2. *Q:* Does synchronized block performance slow?
   *A:* Slight overhead, but JIT optimizes uncontended paths heavily.
3. *Q:* Any alternatives to `synchronized`?
   *A:* Yes‚Äî`java.util.concurrent.atomic` types and `Lock` interfaces.

---

## 4. **Synchronized methods & blocks**

**Use case:** Protecting only critical section.

**Code example:**

```java
void method() {
  synchronized(this) {
    // safe block
  }
}
synchronized void method2() { /* entire method safe */ }
```

**üîç 5 Bullet‚Äëpoints:**

* Method-level: locks on `this` object.
* Block-level: only protects critical section.
* Reduces lock contention for non-critical parts.
* Use block if only a few statements need exclusion.
* Helps prevent deadlocks if used carefully.

**üìù 5‚Äëline summary + code:**
Method-level `synchronized` locks the entire body; block-level lets you be more granular and efficient, minimizing time under lock.

```java
synchronized void fullSafe() { /* safe */ }
void partSafe() {
  synchronized(this) { /* safe part */ }
  // non-critical
}
```

**üé§ Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* Can static methods be synchronized?
   *A:* Yes‚Äîthey lock on the class object.
2. *Q:* Why use block vs method sync?
   *A:* To limit scope and reduce unnecessary lock waiters.
3. *Q:* Can you synchronize on other objects?
   *A:* Yes‚Äîyou can lock any shared object, not just `this`.

## 5. **volatile keyword**

**Use case:** One thread updates a flag; others detect change.

**Code example:**

```java
volatile boolean running = true;
while (running) { /* spin */ }
```

**üîç 5 Bullet‚Äëpoints:**

* Ensures visibility of writes to other threads.
* Prevents caching ‚Äî read/writes go to main memory.
* Doesn‚Äôt guarantee atomicity beyond primitive writes.
* Best for simple flags, not compound ops.
* Cheaper than full synchronization for single-variable sync.

**üìù 5‚Äëline summary + code:**
Volatile makes flag updates visible across threads immediately. It works well for simple state signaling, though complex data still needs locks.

```java
volatile boolean running = true;
if (!running) { /* stop */ }
```

**üé§ Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* Does volatile ensure atomicity?
   *A:* Only for single reads/writes of primitives (not compound ops).
2. *Q:* When would you use volatile?
   *A:* For control flags, one-time initialization patterns.
3. *Q:* Can volatile prevent reordering?
   *A:* Yes‚Äîit imposes memory fencing for consistent ordering.

## 6. **Deadlock Introduction**

**Use case:** Two threads hold locks on different resources and wait on each other.

**Explanation bullets:**

* Occurs when threads wait in a cycle for locks.
* Four Coffman conditions must hold (mutual exclusion, hold-and-wait, no preemption, circular wait).
* Common in nested synchronization.
* Hard to detect & debug.
* Prevention via ordering lock acquisition.

**üìù 5‚Äëline summary + code:**
Deadlock happens when threads lock resources in different orders and wait indefinitely. Fixes include consistent lock ordering or using timeouts with `tryLock()`.

```java
// Discussion only; see next example for code
```

**üé§ Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* Name the four Coffman conditions.
   *A:* Mutual exclusion, hold-and-wait, no-preemption, circular wait.
2. *Q:* How detect deadlock at runtime?
   *A:* Use tools like jstack or JVM deadlock detector (ThreadMXBean).
3. *Q:* Two prevention strategies?
   *A:* Lock ordering and timeout-based locking with `tryLock()`.

---

## 7. **Demo Deadlock & Fixes**

**Use case:** Two threads holding opposite locks.

**Code example:**

```java
Object A = new Object(), B = new Object();

Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
  synchronized (A) {
    Thread.sleep(50);
    synchronized (B) { }
  }
});
Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
  synchronized (B) {
    Thread.sleep(50);
    synchronized (A) { }
  }
});
```

**üîç 5 Bullet‚Äëpoints:**

* `t1` locks A then B; `t2` locks B then A ‚Üí deadlock.
* Both sleep to increase timing chance.
* They wait forever‚Äîclassic deadlock.
* Fix: enforce lock ordering (always lock A then B).
* Or use `tryLock()` with timeout via `ReentrantLock`.

**üìù 5‚Äëline summary + code:**
Two threads deadlock by acquiring locks in reverse order. Fix by consistent ordering or switching to `ReentrantLock` with timeouts.

```java
ReentrantLock lA = new ReentrantLock(), lB = new ReentrantLock();
// use tryLock with timeouts instead of synchronized blocks
```

**üé§ Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* How does `tryLock(timeout)` help?
   *A:* It allows giving up on lock acquisition to avoid deadlock cycle.
2. *Q:* Can deadlocks occur w/o locks?
   *A:* Yes‚Äîin I/O or inter-process sync if circular wait exists.
3. *Q:* Difference between livelock and deadlock?
   *A:* Livelock threads keep responding but make no progress.

## 8. **\[Java 21] Virtual Threads**

**Use case:** High‚Äëscale I/O server with thousands of concurrent connections.

**Code example:**

```java
Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
  String body = Files.readString(Path.of("data.txt"));
  System.out.println(body);
});
```

**üîç 5 Bullet‚Äëpoints:**

* Virtual threads are lightweight, managed by the JDK.
* Allow thousands of concurrent tasks with minimal overhead.
* Block on I/O without tying up OS threads.
* Fully compatible with existing sync APIs.
* Great for server-side and batch jobs.

**üìù 5‚Äëline summary + code:**
Java 21's virtual threads let you spawn massive concurrency cheaply. They block cooperatively, freeing OS threads and simplifying code compared to `CompletableFuture` or event loops.

```java
Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
  // perform I/O or computation
});
```

**üé§ Interview Q\&A:**

1. *Q:* How do virtual threads differ from Platform threads?
   *A:* Virtual threads map to OS threads on demand and use continuations under the hood.
2. *Q:* Can synchronized blocks work with virtual threads?
   *A:* Yes‚Äîlock semantics are identical.
3. *Q:* Any limits on using virtual threads?
   *A:* They should avoid blocking primitives like `LockSupport.park()`‚Äîbut work fine with typical APIs.

## üöÄ 1. Launch Multi‚ÄëFile Source‚ÄëCode Programs

**Use case:** You have multiple classes in separate files (e.g. `Main.java`, `Utils.java`, `Worker.java`) and want to compile and run them efficiently.

**Bullet points:**

* Use `javac` with wildcard or explicit filenames to compile multiple `.java` files.
* Organize packages so that the JVM can locate classes via classpath.
* Use `java -cp` to launch the entry `Main` class.
* Automate compilation and execution using shell scripts or Makefile.
* For larger projects, switch to build tools like Maven or Gradle for dependency management.

**Summary (5 lines):**
You can compile multiple Java files together using `javac *.java`, which creates `.class` files. Ensure each class is in the correct package and directory structure. Then run your program via `java -cp . Main`. Automation is helpful when there are many files. Build tools (e.g. Maven) further streamline this process.

```bash
# compile
javac src/com/example/*.java
# run
java -cp src com.example.Main
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q**: What does `-cp .` do?
   **A**: It tells the JVM to look in the current directory for classes and packages.
2. **Q**: How do you compile Java source files in different subfolders?
   **A**: Use `javac` with wildcards (e.g. `javac src/**/*.java`) or specify all paths.
3. **Q**: Why use Maven/Gradle?
   **A**: They handle dependencies, classpaths, multi-module projects, and automate lifecycles (compile, test, package).

## üü¶ 2. Unnamed Variables & Patterns

**Use case:** Ignoring values you don't intend to use, improving readability and eliminating warnings.

**Bullet points:**

* Use underscore `_` for variables you intentionally ignore (loops, lambdas).
* Prevents compiler warnings for unused locals or exception parameters.
* Improves code clarity by marking ignored values explicitly.
* In pattern matching, use `instanceof Type(_, _)` to ignore unwanted fields.
* Helps simplify switch expressions and cleaned-up code style.

**Summary:**
The `_` variable in Java (since JDK 21/22) lets you declare locals or pattern variables you don't care about. It signals intentional disregard and avoids compiler warnings. It enhances readability, particularly in loops and pattern matching. Just don‚Äôt use the `_` value later‚Äîit‚Äôs purposely unnamed. It integrates cleanly in switch and lambda contexts.

```java
for (int _ : list) process();  // ignore value
if (obj instanceof Point(_, _)) { ... }
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q**: When should you use `_` in Java?
   **A**: When a value is needed syntactically but not used‚Äîfor loops, try/resources, catch, lambdas, patterns.
2. **Q**: Can you read the value bound to `_`?
   **A**: No, it‚Äôs intentionally not bindable‚Äîmeant only to represent ‚Äúunused.‚Äù
3. **Q**: How do unnamed patterns help in record matching?
   **A**: They let you ignore some fields, only match important ones for logic clarity.

## üìÑ 3. Markdown Documentation Comments

**Use case:** Documenting Java code with rich formatting for IDEs and Javadoc generation.

**Bullet points:**

* Use `/** ... */` above classes, methods, constructors, fields.
* Support Markdown syntax in JDK 18+, e.g. `@param`, `@return`, code fences, lists.
* IDEs can render Markdown doc comments inline.
* Enables generating clean, formatted HTML/API documentation.
* Encourages consistent, maintainable documentation practices.

**Summary:**
Javadoc supports Markdown-style documentation comments since JDK 18+. You can use `/** * **Bold** text, `code\`, lists, and links. IDEs show formatted tooltips. The output into HTML is cleaner and more readable. This enhances on‚Äëthe‚Äëfly readability and generated API docs.

````java
/**
 * Adds two numbers.
 * 
 * **Example:**
 * ```java
 * int sum = Utils.add(2, 3);
 * ```
 * @param a first value
 * @param b second value
 * @return sum of inputs
 */
public static int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
````

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q**: What comment type does Javadoc use?
   **A**: Block comments starting with `/**` and ending with `*/`.
2. **Q**: Name some Markdown features in comments.
   **A**: Bold/italic text, inline code, code blocks, lists, links.
3. **Q**: How is it rendered in IDEs?
   **A**: As formatted rich text in tooltips and documentation panels.

## üåä 4. Stream Gatherers API (Java 24+)

**Use case:** Implementing custom intermediate operations (batching, windowing, scanning, etc.) in Java Streams.

**Bullet points:**

* `Gatherer` replaces `Collector` for intermediate stream use (via `stream.gather(...)`).
* Define `initializer()`, `integrator()`, optional `combiner()`, `finisher()`.
* Enables streaming algorithms like sliding windows, running sums, custom filters.
* Supports parallel execution with `combiner()`.
* More flexible than existing stream operations‚Äîstateful, lazy, dynamic pipeline.

**Summary:**
The new Stream Gatherers API (JEP 461/485) introduces `stream.gather(gatherer)` for custom intermediate logic. You provide state init, element integrator, hooks for combining and finishing. It's ideal for batching, windowing, running aggregates, pattern detection, etc. Works in parallel if combiner defined. Greatly expands Stream API flexibility without collecting to a terminal.

```java
List<List<Integer>> batches = Stream.of(1,2,3,4,5,6)
    .gather(Gatherers.windowFixed(3))
    .toList();
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q**: What is a Gatherer?
   **A**: A Stream API interface for defining intermediate, stateful operations.
2. **Q**: How does it differ from Collector?
   **A**: Collector is terminal; Gatherer keeps streams lazy and chainable in intermediate positions.
3. **Q**: What methods must you implement?
   **A**: `initializer()`, `integrator()`, optional `combiner()`, `finisher()`.

### Demo: Window Fixed Batching Gatherer

```java
record WindowFixed<T>(int size) implements Gatherer<T,List<T>,List<T>> {
  public Supplier<List<T>> initializer() { return ()->new ArrayList<>(); }
  public Integrator<List<T>,T,List<T>> integrator() {
    return Gatherer.Integrator.ofGreedy((buf,e,down)->{
      buf.add(e);
      if(buf.size()>=size){
        var out=new ArrayList<>(buf); buf.clear();
        return down.push(out);
      }
      return true;
    });
  }
  public BiConsumer<List<T>,Downstream<? super List<T>>> finisher() {
    return (buf,down)->{ if(!buf.isEmpty()) down.push(new ArrayList<>(buf)); };
  }
}
```
