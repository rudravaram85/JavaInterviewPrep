System.out.println(binary); // Output: 10
```

---

### 19. Type casting in Java

* Type casting converts one data type into another.
* Implicit casting (widening) happens automatically (e.g., int to long).
* Explicit casting (narrowing) requires a cast operator (e.g., double to int).
* Used to handle different data representations safely.
* Essential in arithmetic operations, method calls, and APIs expecting certain types.

**Summary:**
Casting enables data interoperability between types, ensuring compatibility and preventing data loss. Understanding implicit vs explicit casting helps avoid runtime errors and precision loss.

```java
int i = 100;
long l = i;  // implicit widening cast
double d = 9.78;
int j = (int) d;  // explicit narrowing cast
System.out.println(j);  // Output: 9
```

---

### 20. Demo of implicit and explicit casting

* Implicit (widening): smaller to larger data type; safe and automatic.
* Explicit (narrowing): larger to smaller; needs manual cast, may lose data.
* Important to know for correct arithmetic and avoiding exceptions.
* Useful when interfacing APIs or processing user input.
* Prevents errors by clarifying intent in code.

**Summary:**
Implicit casting simplifies data handling when moving to larger types. Explicit casting demands attention to prevent data truncation. Proper casting is essential for reliable Java programs.

```java
int x = 10;
double y = x; // implicit casting
double a = 9.99;
int b = (int) a; // explicit casting
System.out.println(y); // 10.0
System.out.println(b); // 9
```

    }

    void instancePrint() {
        System.out.println("Instance method called");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Printer.printMessage("Hello from static method!");
        Printer p = new Printer();
        p.instancePrint();
    }
}
```

---

### 38. Let’s say hi to main method again

* `public static void main(String[] args)` is Java’s program entry point.
* JVM looks for main method to start execution.
* `String[] args` holds command line arguments.
* `static` means JVM can call without creating object.
* Must be public for JVM access.

**Summary:**
The `main` method acts as the start line for every standalone Java application. Understanding its structure is key for writing programs that run correctly and accept input parameters.

---

### 39. How to create & initialize Java objects

* Use `new` keyword followed by constructor call.
* Syntax: `ClassName obj = new ClassName();`
* Constructor initializes the object’s state.
* Objects are stored on heap memory.
* Fields can be initialized using constructors or setters.

**Summary:**
Object creation and initialization is fundamental in Java OOP. Using constructors ensures objects are set up properly before use, enabling predictable behavior and state management.

**Code example:**

```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println(name + " is " + age + " years old.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p = new Person("Alice", 30);
        p.display();
    }
}
```

---

### 40. Introduction to Constructor in Java

* Special method with the same name as the class.
* Used to initialize new objects.

* Debugging constructors helps identify issues early in object creation.
* Set breakpoints inside constructors in IDEs like IntelliJ.
* Step through constructor execution to verify logic.
* Helps ensure fields are correctly initialized.

**Summary:**
Constructors are the first methods invoked for an object. Debugging them helps catch initialization errors early, making programs more robust. IDEs provide tools to step through constructors line-by-line.

**Code example:**

```java
class Product {
    String name;
    double price;

    Product(String name, double price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price; // Set breakpoint here to debug
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println(name + ": $" + price);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Product p = new Product("Laptop", 999.99);
        p.display();
    }
}
```

---

### 42. Problem with default or no-args constructor

* If no constructor is defined, Java provides a default no-args constructor.
* Default constructor does not initialize fields explicitly.
* Custom constructors remove the default no-args constructor.
* Missing no-args constructor causes compilation errors if code expects it.
* Important for frameworks that rely on no-args constructor (e.g., serialization).

**Summary:**
Relying on the default constructor can lead to uninitialized objects or errors when custom constructors exist. Defining explicit no-args constructors is essential, especially when integrating with certain libraries or frameworks.

---

### 43. Constructor Overloading in Java

* Multiple constructors with different parameter lists in the same class.
* Enables object creation with different initial states.
* Helps provide flexibility to users of the class.
* Java differentiates based on method signature.
* Overloading improves code readability and usability.

**Summary:**
Constructor overloading lets developers offer multiple ways to create objects, catering to different initialization needs while maintaining a clean API.

**Code example:**

```java
class Book {
    String title;
    String author;

### 44. Constructor chaining in Java

* Calling one constructor from another using `this()` keyword.
* Helps avoid code duplication in constructors.
* Must be the first statement in the constructor.
* Improves maintainability by centralizing initialization.
* Can chain multiple constructors in a sequence.

**Summary:**
Constructor chaining provides a clean, DRY way to initialize objects. It avoids repeated code and ensures consistent initialization logic across constructors.

---

### 45. Usage of return statement in constructor

* Constructors do **not** have a return type, so they cannot return values.
* `return;` statement can be used to exit constructor early but without a value.
* Using `return;` is rare and mostly unnecessary in constructors.
* Cannot return objects or primitives explicitly from constructors.
* Trying to return a value from constructor causes compile error.

**Summary:**
Unlike regular methods, constructors cannot return values. The `return;` keyword is only used to exit a constructor prematurely without returning data.

---

### 46. Instance Initialization Block in Java class - Part 1

* Code block defined with `{ ... }` inside a class but outside methods/constructors.
* Runs **every time** an object is created, before the constructor.
* Useful for common initialization shared by all constructors.
* Helps avoid code duplication when multiple constructors exist.
* Runs after field initializers but before constructor body.

**Summary:**
Instance Initialization Blocks provide a way to share initialization code across constructors. They are less common but useful for complex setup that applies regardless of constructor.

---

### 47. Instance Initialization Block in Java class - Part 2

* Can access instance variables and methods.
* Multiple instance blocks execute in order they appear.
* Helps in situations where constructors call each other but some init logic is common.
* Useful for logging or resource setup at object creation.
* Instance blocks run **before** constructor code executes.

**Summary:**
Instance initialization blocks offer a middle ground between field initializers and constructors, giving a unified place for initialization that always runs first during object creation.

**Code example:**

```java
class Demo {
    int x;
    {
        x = 10; // Instance Initialization Block
        System.out.println("Instance block executed");
    }

    Demo() {
        System.out.println("Constructor executed, x = " + x);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Demo();
    }
}
```

### 48. Introduction to static variables in Java

* Declared with `static` keyword inside class but outside methods.
* Belongs to the class, not to any specific object.
* Shared across all instances of the class.
* Initialized once when class loads into JVM.
* Useful for constants or shared counters.

**Summary:**
Static variables provide shared state or constants at the class level, accessible without object creation. They reduce memory usage and provide class-wide values.

---

### 49. How to define constant final static variables

* Use `static final` modifiers to declare constants.
* Constant values cannot be changed once initialized.
* Naming convention: uppercase letters with underscores.
* Initialized during declaration or in static blocks.
* Accessed via `ClassName.CONSTANT_NAME`.

**Summary:**
Final static variables are constants by design, ensuring values remain immutable and accessible globally, often used for configuration or fixed values.

**Code example:**

```java
class Constants {
    static final double PI = 3.14159;
    static final int MAX_USERS = 100;
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("PI: " + Constants.PI);
        System.out.println("Max Users: " + Constants.MAX_USERS);
    }
}
```

Great! Here’s the next set of 10 topics with explanations, summaries, and code examples where needed:

---

### 50. Differences between static & instance variables

* **Static variables** belong to the class, shared among all objects.
* **Instance variables** belong to individual objects; each object has its own copy.
* Static variables are initialized once when the class loads; instance variables when each object is created.
* Static variables accessed via class name; instance variables accessed via object references.
* Static variables useful for shared data; instance variables store object-specific data.

**Summary:**
Static and instance variables differ mainly in scope and lifecycle. Static variables are shared across all instances and exist once per class, while instance variables belong to and vary with each object.

---

### 51. Introduction to static methods in Java

* Static methods belong to the class, not any instance.
* Can be called without creating an object.
* Cannot access instance variables/methods directly.
* Often used for utility or helper methods.
* Use `static` keyword for declaration.

**Summary:**
Static methods provide class-level functionality callable without objects, commonly used for utility operations or when instance data isn’t required.

**Code example:**

```java
class MathUtil {
    static int square(int n) {
        return n * n;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(MathUtil.square(5));  // 25
    }
}
```

---

### 52. Static Initialization Block in Java class

* A special block to initialize static variables.
* Runs once when the class is loaded into JVM.
* Useful when initialization requires logic beyond simple assignment.
* Executes before any static methods or variables are accessed.
* Multiple static blocks execute in the order they appear.

**Summary:**
Static initialization blocks enable complex static variable initialization and run once at class load time, before any static method or variable usage.

---

### 53. Debugging of method invocations in IntelliJ

* Set breakpoints on method calls to pause execution.
* Step into methods to see detailed flow.
* Step over to run methods without going inside.
* Inspect parameters and local variables during debugging.
* Helps identify logical or runtime errors interactively.

**Summary:**
IntelliJ provides powerful debugging tools to trace method calls step-by-step, allowing deeper understanding and faster bug fixes.

---

### 54. Where does Java store classes, objects, variables, methods

* **Classes**: Loaded into Method Area (part of JVM memory).
* **Objects**: Created on Heap memory.
* **Local variables**: Stored in Stack memory per thread.
* **Methods**: Stored in Method Area along with class info.
* Helps JVM manage memory efficiently.

**Summary:**
JVM manages memory by segregating code, objects, and variables into distinct areas, facilitating efficient execution and garbage collection.

---

### 55. Deep dive on Heap memory and stack memory

* **Heap:** Stores objects and instance variables, shared across threads, garbage collected.
* **Stack:** Stores method frames, local variables, and method calls, thread-specific.
* Stack frames created/destroyed as methods are called/returned.
* Stack memory is limited but fast; heap is larger but slower.
* Proper management avoids memory leaks and stack overflow errors.

**Summary:**
Heap and stack are crucial JVM memory areas; understanding their roles helps write efficient, safe Java programs.

---

### 56. Introduction to null in Java

* `null` represents the absence of any object reference.
* Variables can be assigned `null` to indicate “no object”.
* Accessing methods/fields on `null` causes `NullPointerException`.
* Useful to initialize references or reset them.
* Always check for null before using object references.

**Summary:**
`null` is a special marker for “no object” in Java; cautious handling avoids common runtime exceptions.

---

### 57. Object Destruction and Garbage collection in Java

* Java automatically frees memory for unreachable objects via Garbage Collector (GC).
* No manual memory management by programmer.
* GC runs in background and reclaims heap space.
* Object finalization (`finalize()` method) is deprecated; not reliable.
* Helps prevent memory leaks but timing of GC is unpredictable.

**Summary:**
Java’s Garbage Collector manages memory cleanup, simplifying development but requiring understanding for optimal performance.

---

### 58. Class vs Object vs Instance vs Reference

* **Class:** Blueprint or template for objects.
* **Object:** Actual instance created from class.
* **Instance:** Same as object; one occurrence of a class.
* **Reference:** Variable holding the address of the object in memory.
* Class defines structure; objects hold data and behavior.

**Summary:**
Classes define structure, objects are concrete realizations, instances are synonymous with objects, and references point to objects in memory.
