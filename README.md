### On Classes, Methods, Fields, and Constructors

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Basic Level (1â€“10)**

1. **What is a class in Java?**
   âž¤ A class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created. It defines fields (attributes) and methods (behavior).

2. **What is an object in Java?**
   âž¤ An object is an instance of a class containing state (fields) and behavior (methods).

3. **What are fields in Java?**
   âž¤ Fields are variables declared inside a class to hold the data/state of an object.

4. **What is a method in Java?**
   âž¤ A method is a block of code that performs a specific task, defined inside a class.

5. **What is a constructor?**
   âž¤ A constructor is a special method used to initialize new objects. It has the same name as the class and no return type.

6. **Can a class have multiple constructors?**
   âž¤ Yes, this is called constructor overloading â€” multiple constructors with different parameter lists.

7. **What is the default constructor?**
   âž¤ The no-argument constructor automatically provided by Java if no constructor is explicitly defined.

8. **What is the difference between instance and static fields?**
   âž¤ Instance fields belong to objects; static fields belong to the class itself and are shared among all instances.

9. **What is method overloading?**
   âž¤ Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists within the same class.

10. **Can methods be overloaded based on return type only?**
    âž¤ No. Method overloading requires different parameter lists, not just different return types.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Intermediate Level (11â€“20)**

11. **What is method overriding?**
    âž¤ When a subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in the superclass.

12. **What is the difference between `this` and `super` keywords?**
    âž¤ `this` refers to the current object; `super` refers to the superclass of the current object.

13. **Can constructors be inherited?**
    âž¤ No. Constructors are not inherited but can be called from subclass constructors using `super()`.

14. **What is a static method?**
    âž¤ A method that belongs to the class rather than an instance and can be called without creating an object.

15. **Can a static method access instance variables?**
    âž¤ No. Static methods can only access static variables directly.

16. **What is encapsulation?**
    âž¤ Encapsulation is the technique of wrapping fields and methods inside a class and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

17. **What is the use of access modifiers?**
    âž¤ Access modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`, default) control the visibility of classes, fields, and methods.

18. **Can a class have private constructors? Why?**
    âž¤ Yes. Itâ€™s used to restrict instantiation, often in Singleton design patterns.

19. **What is the purpose of the `final` keyword when applied to a method?**
    âž¤ It prevents method overriding in subclasses.

20. **What is an anonymous class?**
    âž¤ A class without a name defined and instantiated in a single expression, often used to override methods of classes or interfaces on the fly.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Advanced Level (21â€“25)**

21. **What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy of an object?**
    âž¤ Shallow copy copies object references, so both objects share the same data. Deep copy duplicates all objects and data.

22. **How does Java support constructor chaining?**
    âž¤ By using `this()` to call another constructor in the same class, or `super()` to call the superclass constructor.

23. **What is the use of the `static` block in a class?**
    âž¤ It is used to initialize static fields and runs once when the class is loaded.

24. **Can you override a static method?**
    âž¤ No. Static methods are hidden, not overridden.

25. **What are instance initializer blocks?**
    âž¤ Blocks of code inside a class (outside methods) that run every time an instance is created, before the constructor.

### âœ… **25 Java Inheritance Interview Questions and Answers**

#### ðŸ”¹ Basic Level (1â€“10)

1. **What is inheritance in Java?**
   âž¤ Inheritance is an OOP feature that allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (fields and methods) from another class (parent/superclass).

2. **What are the types of inheritance supported by Java?**
   âž¤ Java supports:

   * Single Inheritance
   * Multilevel Inheritance
   * Hierarchical Inheritance
     âž¤ Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes directly but does through interfaces.

3. **Why is multiple inheritance not supported in Java with classes?**
   âž¤ To avoid ambiguity and complexity like the Diamond Problem. Java uses interfaces to resolve such issues.

4. **What is the difference between `extends` and `implements`?**
   âž¤ `extends` is used to inherit from a class.
   âž¤ `implements` is used to inherit from an interface.

5. **Can constructors be inherited?**
   âž¤ No. Constructors are not inherited, but can be called via `super()`.

6. **What is the use of the `super` keyword?**
   âž¤ Used to access the superclass constructor, methods, or variables.

7. **What is method overriding?**
   âž¤ A subclass providing its own implementation of a method defined in its superclass.

8. **What is the difference between overloading and overriding?**
   âž¤ **Overloading**: Same method name, different parameters.
   âž¤ **Overriding**: Same method signature, subclass redefines it.

9. **Can private methods be overridden?**
   âž¤ No. They are not visible to the subclass.

10. **Can a subclass access private members of a superclass?**
    âž¤ No. Only via public/protected methods if provided.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Level (11â€“20)

11. **What is dynamic method dispatch?**
    âž¤ A mechanism where a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime.

12. **Can final methods be overridden?**
    âž¤ No. Final methods cannot be overridden.

13. **Can static methods be overridden?**
    âž¤ No. They are hidden, not overridden.

14. **What happens if a subclass constructor does not call `super()` explicitly?**
    âž¤ Java inserts a call to the superclassâ€™s no-arg constructor. If it doesn't exist, a compilation error occurs.

15. **Can a subclass override a method with a more restrictive access modifier?**
    âž¤ No. The access level must be the same or more accessible.

16. **How can you prevent a class from being subclassed?**
    âž¤ Declare it as `final`.

17. **What happens when a subclass has the same method as a superclass and you call it via the superclass reference?**
    âž¤ The subclassâ€™s version runs â€” runtime polymorphism.

18. **Can an abstract class have constructors?**
    âž¤ Yes.

19. **What is the default access modifier of a class?**
    âž¤ Package-private.

20. **Is it possible to call a superclass method from the subclass?**
    âž¤ Yes, using `super.methodName()`.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Advanced Level (21â€“25)

21. **What happens if two interfaces implemented by a class have the same method signature?**
    âž¤ One implementation is enough.

22. **How does Java resolve the diamond problem with interfaces?**
    âž¤ The implementing class must override the conflicting method explicitly.

23. **Can you inherit both a class and an interface in Java?**
    âž¤ Yes.

24. **What are the limitations of inheritance?**
    âž¤ Tight coupling, less flexibility.

25. **When should you prefer composition over inheritance?**
    âž¤ When you want more flexibility or change behavior at runtime (`has-a` relationship).

## âœ… 25 Java Interface Interview Questions and Answers

### ðŸ”¹ **Basic Level (1â€“10)**

---

1. **What is an interface in Java?**
   âž¤ An interface is a reference type in Java, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Interfaces cannot be instantiated and are used to specify a contract that classes must implement.

---

2. **How is an interface different from an abstract class?**
   âž¤ Key differences:

   * Interfaces support multiple inheritance, abstract classes donâ€™t.
   * Abstract classes can have constructors and instance variables; interfaces canâ€™t (except constants).
   * Interfaces are fully abstract (until Java 7); from Java 8, they can have default and static methods.

---

3. **Can an interface contain method implementations in Java?**
   âž¤ Yes, from Java 8 onward, interfaces can have:

   * **Default methods** (with `default` keyword)
   * **Static methods**

---

4. **What are default methods in interfaces?**
   âž¤ A `default` method is a method with a body in an interface. It allows the interface to provide a default implementation without breaking existing classes.

---

5. **What are static methods in interfaces?**
   âž¤ Static methods belong to the interface itself and are not inherited by implementing classes. They must be called using the interface name.

---

6. **Can interfaces have constructors?**
   âž¤ No. Interfaces cannot have constructors because they cannot be instantiated.

---

7. **Can we create an object of an interface?**
   âž¤ No. Interfaces cannot be instantiated directly. You must implement them in a class and instantiate that class.

---

8. **Can an interface extend another interface?**
   âž¤ Yes. An interface can extend one or more other interfaces using the `extends` keyword.

---

9. **Can a class implement multiple interfaces?**
   âž¤ Yes. A class can implement multiple interfaces, which is Javaâ€™s way of supporting multiple inheritance.

---

10. **What is the syntax for implementing an interface in a class?**

```java
interface MyInterface {
    void show();
}

class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Implementation");
    }
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Intermediate Level (11â€“20)**

---

11. **Can an interface extend multiple interfaces?**
    âž¤ Yes. Interfaces can extend multiple other interfaces.

```java
interface A {}
interface B {}
interface C extends A, B {}
```

---

12. **Can an interface have variables?**
    âž¤ Yes, but they are implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final` (i.e., constants).

---

13. **What is the default access modifier for methods in interfaces?**
    âž¤ Prior to Java 9: `public abstract`.
    âž¤ Java 8+ can also have `default` and `static`.
    âž¤ Java 9+ allows `private` methods inside interfaces.

---

14. **What happens if a class does not implement all methods of an interface?**
    âž¤ It must be declared `abstract`. Otherwise, a compile-time error occurs.

---

15. **Can we use access modifiers with interface methods?**
    âž¤ Yes, but only `public`, `default`, `private`, and `static` (Java 8+).

---

16. **Can a class both extend a class and implement an interface?**
    âž¤ Yes. Java allows:

```java
class MyClass extends SuperClass implements MyInterface {}
```

---

17. **What is a functional interface?**
    âž¤ An interface with **exactly one abstract method**. It can have multiple default or static methods.

---

18. **What is the purpose of `@FunctionalInterface` annotation?**
    âž¤ It marks an interface as functional and helps the compiler report an error if the interface contains more than one abstract method.

---

19. **What are marker interfaces in Java?**
    âž¤ Interfaces with no methods or fields, used to "mark" a class for special behavior.
    **Examples**: `Serializable`, `Cloneable`.

---

20. **How do interfaces support multiple inheritance in Java?**
    âž¤ A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to inherit behaviors from multiple sources, thus achieving multiple inheritance.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Advanced Level (21â€“25)**

---

21. **How is a conflict resolved when a class implements two interfaces with the same default method?**
    âž¤ The implementing class must **override** the conflicting method to resolve ambiguity.

---

22. **Can we override interface static methods in implementing classes?**
    âž¤ No. Static methods in interfaces are not inherited by implementing classes, hence cannot be overridden.

---

23. **Can we define private methods in interfaces?**
    âž¤ Yes, from Java 9 onward. Private methods can be used to share code between default and static methods within the interface.

---

24. **Why use interfaces when abstract classes can serve similar purposes?**
    âž¤ Interfaces promote loose coupling, support multiple inheritance, and are ideal for defining APIs and contracts in large systems.

---

25. **How are interfaces used in real-time applications?**
    âž¤ Interfaces are used to:

* Define **contracts** in frameworks (e.g., `List`, `Map`, `Runnable`).
* Enable **dependency injection** and **loose coupling** in Spring.
* Support **polymorphism** in design patterns like **Strategy** and **Observer**.
